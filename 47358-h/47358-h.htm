<h1 title="">THE BOY SCOUTS AFOOT IN FRANCE</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">LANDED IN ANTWERP</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here we are, up the River Schelde at last,
and landing at old Antwerp, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right, Thad, and glad to set foot
again on solid ground, after that long trip over
the North Sea from Rotterdam, away up in Holland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course Bumpus is happy, because he expects
to join his mother here at the Sanitarium. We all
hope you&rsquo;ll find her much improved, and ready to
start for the good old United States, where peace
hangs out and folks don&rsquo;t dream of lining up in
battle array like they&rsquo;re all doing over here in
Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Thad, I am hugging that same wish
to my heart myself right along. Just as soon as we
can get some sort of vehicle let&rsquo;s head for the Institution.
I&rsquo;m in a cold sweat for fear something
may have happened. It&rsquo;s a long time since I heard
from my poor mother, you know, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you worried all the time we were drifting
down the Rhine on that boat we chartered; and
Bumpus, I really believe you&rsquo;ve been thinking of
your mother every hour we spent trying our best
to get through Belgium, while running into so many
snags at every turn that we finally had to go into
Holland and take a steamer here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admit all you say, Giraffe, I humbly do, for
you see she&rsquo;s the only mother I&rsquo;ve got. But please
look for a vehicle, Thad, or you, Allan. I have cold
spells, and then flashes of fever by turns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking we may have considerable trouble
finding any sort of conveyance, because most horses
and cars have been seized by the Belgian military
authorities. But we&rsquo;ll do our best, and money generally
talks over here as it does in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were four of the boys in the bunch. All
of them wore more or less faded khaki suits, and
had battered campaign hats on their heads, which
facts told louder than words could have done that
they must belong to that famous organization known
as the Boy Scouts of America.</p>
<p>First, to introduce them in as short a space as
possible, for the convenience of any reader who may
be making their acquaintance for the first time, let
it be set down that their names were Thad Brewster,
Allan Hollister, &ldquo;Bumpus&rdquo; Hawtree and &ldquo;Giraffe&rdquo;
Stedman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>The Hawtree lad was once in a while known as
&ldquo;Cornelius Jasper&rdquo;; and on rare occasions he who
answered to the family name of Stedman, a lanky
chap in the bargain, had &ldquo;Conrad&rdquo; tacked to his
address; but never when in the society of his comrades
of the baseball or football field, or when scouring
the country in the company of those who wore
the khaki.</p>
<p>These lads were all members of the Silver Fox
Patrol connected with Cranford Troop of Boy
Scouts; and the enterprising town in which they
lived was located in the eastern part of the States.</p>
<p>They had seen many strange sights, and passed
through a host of experiences, both singular and
thrilling, as any one who has read previous volumes
in this series can attest. Perhaps the most remarkable
of all their exploits had come to them during
this summer upon finding themselves in Germany
when the Great War suddenly broke out, and they
had the time of their lives trying to get past the
fiercely contending Belgian and Teuton armies, in
the endeavor to reach the city of Antwerp on the
River Schelde.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>A few words with regard to the reason for their
being abroad would perhaps not come in amiss here,
in order that the reader may understand what follows:
It had come about that Mrs. Hawtree, being
ill, was recommended to go to Antwerp and stop for
a season at a famous Sanitarium, where celebrated
physicians who had made a specialty of such cases
as hers would very likely be able to render her more
or less assistance, possibly effect a permanent cure.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawtree, being unable to accompany his wife
on account of pressing business engagements, sent
his son instead. As Bumpus was usually an &ldquo;easy
mark&rdquo; on account of his good nature, it was arranged
that his faithful chums, Thad, Allan and Giraffe,
accompany him, half of the expense being paid
by the Hawtrees.</p>
<p>So they had left the lady in Antwerp, and then
started out to put a long-cherished plan into operation.
At a certain city on the Upper Rhine they
chartered a boat, aboard which they began to descend
the wonderfully beautiful river, admiring the
famous old castles on its banks, and having a &ldquo;simply
glorious time,&rdquo; as Bumpus himself always put it.</p>
<p>Then came the thunderbolt when they learned
how war had suddenly broken out, with the great
German military machine pouring troops over the
Belgian border by tens and hundreds of thousands,
thinking to catch France totally unprepared, so
that Paris could be taken, and the country forced
to its knees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>The boys had hastily abandoned their cruise on
the Rhine, and, securing an old rattletrap of a car,
for fear a good one might be taken from them, they
started for the border, in hopes of getting across,
and finally reaching Antwerp.</p>
<p>But after many adventures they had finally been
forced to change their plans, retreating to Holland
instead, and then coming around by way of the
North Sea. So here they were, safe at last at their
destination, and glad to know that they had broken
down all obstacles to their progress.</p>
<p>Thad Brewster was the leader. He held the position
by virtue of his commanding nature, as well
as the fact that he was at the head of the Silver
Fox Patrol, and indeed often served as scout-master
of the troop in the absence of the duly authorized
gentleman who occupied that lofty office.</p>
<p>On his part Allan Hollister could claim to be the
best-posted member of the troop when it came to a
knowledge of woodcraft and an acquaintance with
the denizens of the wilderness in the shape of fur,
fin and feather, for he was a Maine boy, and that
stands for a great deal.</p>
<p>Giraffe, he of the long &ldquo;rubber-neck,&rdquo; was a master
hand at several things, though it must be admitted
that he took more pride in his ability to start
a fire in a dozen different ways than concerning anything
else he did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>As for Bumpus, he did not claim to excel in anything,
unless it was a remarkably good judgment
with various kinds of food and ways in which to
prepare them so as to arouse the appetites of his
mates.</p>
<p>It happened that they found little difficulty in securing
the services of a driver, since they had made
up their minds not to scorn any sort of vehicle so
long as it got them to the Sanitarium on that August
morning.</p>
<p>As they bundled in with their scanty luggage and
started off from the quay at which the steamer from
Rotterdam had tied up, the boys naturally found
themselves keenly interested in all they saw. Antwerp
under war conditions was quite a different
city from the rather quiet, staid place they had
thought it before. Indeed, all of them admitted that
it fairly <i>seethed</i> with excitement, and was full of
most thrilling sights just then.</p>
<p>Men in soldierly garments could be seen on the
streets, all apparently hurrying toward some central
point of mobilization. Twice the boys heard the
clatter of many horses&rsquo; hoofs as their carriage was
drawn hastily aside to allow a battery of field-pieces
to pass by with a whirl. These were possibly heading
for the front, where the Belgians still heroically
resisted this forced invasion of their country by
their powerful and unscrupulous northern neighbor,
one of the countries guaranteeing the neutrality of
Belgium at that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Cars shot this way and that like hurrying meteors.
Often they could see that officers of rank occupied
them. For all they knew the boys may have been
looking on the King of the Belgians himself, though
it was more probable that Albert kept much closer
to the firing line while his men were sacrificing
themselves for the national honor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest to goodness!&rdquo; Giraffe was heard saying
as they surveyed all these interesting sights, turning
their heads constantly from side to side like boys in
a &ldquo;three-ringed&rdquo; circus. &ldquo;I kind-a hate to get away
from here while things are booming this way. It&rsquo;s
a chance in a life-time to see what war means. I
seem to feel something strange stirring within me
every time I think of how these brave Belgians are
trying to hold the Kaiser&rsquo;s terrible military machine
in check, and somehow I imagine it may be
hero-worship that ails me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted the more practical Bumpus,
&ldquo;more&rsquo;n likely it&rsquo;s that cucumber salad you had
aboard the steamer for supper last night. It gave
me a few spasms myself, and you know I&rsquo;m nearly
fool-proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s the Sanitarium ahead of us,&rdquo; suggested
Thad just then, and of course Bumpus had
nothing more to say; though his face again assumed
that anxious expression so foreign to its usually
calm and satisfied condition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Holding the vehicle at their service, the four boys
hastened to enter the grounds of the big and famous
institution. Somehow it struck Thad as though
there was lacking considerable of the bustle he had
noticed when there before. He fell to wondering
what that sign could mean, and if poor Bumpus was
to have a bitter disappointment after all his trouble.</p>
<p>Gaining the office they found that instead of the
pompous individual whom they had met before, a
rather obscure-looking party now held forth, undoubtedly
a subordinate. Bumpus hastened to push
forward, and they saw him talking with this party,
who evidently was able to comprehend and speak
English. Indeed, many of the patients came from
foreign parts, even distant America, so it was only
natural that those in charge must be linguists.</p>
<p>Bumpus looked as though far from happy, Thad
noticed. The official, after satisfying himself that
the stout, red-cheeked boy was the party he claimed
to be, had produced a letter, which he handed over.
This Bumpus had opened with trembling hands and
was seen to devour greedily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something gone wrong, take it from me,&rdquo;
remarked Giraffe, as they saw the other starting
toward them, still gripping his letter and looking
pretty pale. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s hit you, Bumpus?&rdquo; he continued,
not coldly, but really with a touch of brotherly
sympathy in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! what do you think!&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpus,
bitterly; &ldquo;my mother has gone to Paris with the
head doctor, most of the staff and some of the
patients, and she wants me to join her there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">HELD UP ON THE BORDER</span></h2>
<p>When Bumpus put up this piteous plaint the
other scouts exchanged glances. Here was an unexpected
complication that faced them, a puzzling
riddle that would have to be solved.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, when the news reached Antwerp
that the great Kaiser had sent his terrible army into
Belgium, it was realized that although King Albert&rsquo;s
little army might offer a desperate defense
that would cover them with immortal fame, there
would be but one end to such an uneven struggle.
The Belgians might inflict more or less sanguinary
losses on the Teuton host, but the machine-roller
would eventually overwhelm them, and even Antwerp
must fall into the hands of the invaders. And
so the managers of the famous Spa had concluded
that it would be just as well if they changed their
location. They had a companion Cure in Paris, as
the boys well knew, and, accordingly, the entire
faculty, together with the trained nurses and most
of the rich patients as well, had taken their departure
some time before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>If, indeed, Paris were seriously threatened by the
Germans, it might be like jumping from the frying-pan
into the fire. At least the step had been taken,
and here was Bumpus looking aghast at the idea of
trying to follow his mother, when the whole of
Northern France must be seething with war preparations,
trains taken over for military purposes, private
cars commandeered, and every available horse
drafted into the service of the government.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that Giraffe presently broke
out in his explosive way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz! Here&rsquo;s a pretty kettle of fish, now!&rdquo;
he ejaculated. &ldquo;Your mother is in Paris, it seems
like, just when the Kaiser&rsquo;s army is heading that
way hot-footed. And she asks you to follow after
her, does she, Bumpus? Whew! I can see a bunch
of fellows I know breaking into a lot of new trouble
trying to dodge a million fighters, more or less. But
remember. Bumpus, we&rsquo;re bound to stick to you
whatever happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The party addressed gave Giraffe a look of affection.
He could not trust his voice to utter a single
word just then, being so completely overcome with
emotion, brought on by his bitter disappointment.</p>
<p>As usual, they turned to Thad. When things all
went wrong it was queer how these boys of the
Silver Fox Patrol placed their dependence on Thad
Brewster to guide them out of the wilderness; and
rarely had he failed them in an emergency.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;We might be able to make it,&rdquo; the leader told
them, seriously, as though he had been weighing the
chances in his mind and already reached a decision;
&ldquo;that is, if things favored us about getting away
from here. We ought to go to the railway station
at once and see when the first train for Paris starts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, from all accounts we&rsquo;ve had, the Germans
are already far over the border, and there is desperate
fighting going on in a dozen places on French
soil,&rdquo; observed the cautious Allan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mentioning
this fact, not because you&rsquo;ll find me hanging back
whatever you decide to do, but only to get the situation
clear in our minds before we take the jump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got an idea of your own, I take it,
Allan?&rdquo; suggested Thad quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since we&rsquo;ve come all the way from Rotterdam
by sea and found the going good, what&rsquo;s to
hinder our looking up a boat starting that would
carry us to Calais, Dunkirk or Boulogne? It strikes
me that if we did manage to land at one of those seaports
we&rsquo;d stand a much better chance of getting
through to Paris over the railroad than by coming
down here from Belgium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bright thought, Allan,&rdquo; admitted Thad, &ldquo;so
let&rsquo;s climb aboard our rig and scurry back to the
docks again, to inquire about the departure of southbound
steamers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>They were speedily hastening back to the river,
where those bustling scenes were hourly taking place,
for even at this early date every boat leaving for
London was packed to its capacity with fugitive
tourists trying to get out of the war-stricken country.</p>
<p>Upon inquiry the boys found that they were up
against a disappointment. A boat had left only
an hour before for Boulogne; indeed, they remembered
seeing it passing down the Schelde as they
neared the docks. There would not be another bound
for a port in France for three days, as most of the
vessels were being impressed into the cross channel
service just then, heading for England.</p>
<p>Realizing that there was no help for it, Thad suggested
that they give up the scheme of going by sea.
That long delay was terrible to even think of, and
Bumpus could never stand idling his time away when
he wanted so much to be on the move.</p>
<p>It was thereupon decided that they seek the railway
<i>gare</i> and board the first train that left for Paris.
Of course this meant they would have to take great
risks, for it could be understood that there was no
telling what delays they were likely to face. Still,
they had no choice in the matter, unless they chose
to cross to London and take chances of being able
to reach France in that roundabout way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Shortly afterward they drove up to the railway
<i>gare</i> and dismissed their driver. Here, as everywhere,
they found things in the utmost confusion.
Every uniformed man was being besieged by a score
of wild-eyed persons all wanting to know how soon
their train would start, and if there was any hope
that it might reach the destination for which it was
billed. They had the poor servants of the company
almost frantic with trying to pacify them and be
civil at the same time.</p>
<p>Thad went about the business in his customary
cool, deliberate fashion. First, he learned that a
train would actually start for Paris within the hour,
though the official who gave him this information
merely shrugged his shoulders in an eloquent way
when asked whether there was any chance of its
reaching the French capital.</p>
<p>Next Thad booked himself and three chums for
the journey. They would have to share the third-class
compartment with a number of other fugitives,
all wild to shake the dust of Belgium off their shoes
before those terrible Germans overran the whole
country. This, however, did not bother the boys,
for they were accustomed to camping out and taking
things as they found them. A little crowding
was to be expected under such remarkable conditions
as prevailed at such a time as this. All of
them said they could stand it if the other people
were able to endure the crush.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>When, later on, the signal was given for the
heavily laden train to start, there were numerous
persons who had not been able to find accommodations
aboard. This came through the ever-growing
desire to get away from the city which undoubtedly
sooner or later would hear the crashing detonations
of the monster mortars that had already smashed
the steel-domed defenses of Liege and Namur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is what I call rushing things some,&rdquo;
observed Giraffe, as he looked out from the window
near his elbow and saw that they were already leaving
the environs of the Belgian seaport behind them.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as much as two hours ago that we landed
here expecting to pick up Bumpus&rsquo; mother and then
take passage across the English Channel to London,
yet here we are heading right into trouble again,
and like as not with a good chance of seeing more
fighting than fell to our share before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the minutes continued to glide by and they
kept going at a good pace the boys began to hope
they might by great luck manage to get by the scene
of hostilities without being held up. Bumpus looked
at his little nickel watch ever so often. No doubt
the time dragged with him as never before, for his
faithful heart must be filled with misgivings concerning
his sick mother.</p>
<p>Thad, always observing, saw how the boy was
worrying, and he several times uttered words of
cheer that were calculated to buoy the other&rsquo;s hopes
up more or less.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take courage, Bumpus,&rdquo; he told him, &ldquo;and look
back at our record when you feel despondent. We
have always managed, somehow or other, to accomplish
whatever we set out to do, you&rsquo;ll remember.
No matter how difficult the task may have seemed,
we have been highly favored by good fortune. And
we&rsquo;ll come through this time with colors flying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to be ashamed to let myself have a
single doubt, Thad,&rdquo; Bumpus frankly admitted, as
he turned his eyes upon the leader in whom he had
such implicit faith, &ldquo;when right now I&rsquo;ve got the
backing of the best pards that ever donned the
khaki. Yes, I&rsquo;m going to shut my teeth hard together,
and tell myself that we&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to get to Paris,
no matter if a whole German army corps stands in
the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks! I should say so,&rdquo; Giraffe hastened to
remark, for he had been listening to all that went
on in spite of the jabbering of other inmates of the
compartment, mostly French people hastening back
home. &ldquo;And, say, a railway train isn&rsquo;t the only
means of travel in these enlightened days; there are
cars, and even aeroplanes, if you must come to it;
though it&rsquo;d have to be a buster of a heavier-than-air
machine that could tote Bumpus fifty miles across
country, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They talked from time to time as they continued
to progress over the low country that lies toward the
border from Antwerp, where canals seemed to predominate;
and the boys were often reminded of the
Dutch lands that had been reclaimed from the sea
by the erection of the great dikes to shut the water
out of Flanders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>They knew that as the minutes passed they were
undoubtedly drawing closer to that region where
trouble would possibly be lying in wait for them, if
it came about that they were fated to be held up on
their journey to the French capital.</p>
<p>Hence every time the train slackened speed
Bumpus would glue his eyes on the landscape as seen
through the open window, just as if he more than
half-expected to discover a horde of Uhlans, with
their lances and pennons and prancing horses, waiting
to take the fugitives into camp as prisoners.</p>
<p>Finally as the afternoon began to wear away they
did come to a halt in a small town. Thad announced
that he believed they must now be on the
border between Belgium and France. Here, if anywhere,
they ought to be able to learn what the immediate
future held in store for them.</p>
<p>A guard unlocked the door of their carriage. Thad
could see that the man was looking displeased, as
he made gestures with his hand to indicate that they
must all get out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they mean to search us for prohibited
articles, such as tobacco and spirits,&rdquo; Allan went
on to say, as they hastened to comply with the order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that&rsquo;s the extent of the trouble,&rdquo; ventured
the doubting Bumpus; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m awfully afraid
this means we&rsquo;re going to find ourselves in the soup.
I wish we could coax that fellow to give us a little
information; try him, won&rsquo;t you, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>There was only one way of making the guard talk,
and Thad understood the value of a generous tip; so
he managed to slip a coin in the willing palm of the
uniformed man, and then asked him something.</p>
<p>Thad had picked up a little French and could manage
to make himself understood. Then again the
guard would readily guess just what each and every
passenger aboard the detained train must be anxious
about, for it concerned their chances of continuing
the journey into France.</p>
<p>While their leader was holding this animated talk
with the guard, supplemented on the part of the
native with sundry expressive shrugs that spoke
more eloquently than words, the other three boys
stood near by, holding their luggage, and wondering
what fortune had in store for them next. So many
strange things had happened to the party since coming
across the sea that they were rapidly getting to
a point where nothing surprised them very much.</p>
<p>Presently Thad joined them. His face looked
grave, and poor Bumpus groaned as he anticipated
the worst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This train is going to be abandoned right here,
boys,&rdquo; Thad told them. &ldquo;They had information
that the Germans have overrun the country it must
pass through, and there would be no hope of our
getting to Paris. We&rsquo;ve got to try some other way
around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">DOWN THE SLOPE</span></h2>
<p>Upon hearing this unpleasant news poor Bumpus
looked broken-hearted. He seemed to see a host
of obstacles confronting him. Paris must have been
something like a thousand miles away just then, according
to his enlarged view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like the luck,&rdquo; he sighed desolately; &ldquo;things
were moving along too fine to last. I had a sneaking
idea in my mind something was bound to blow
up before long. What under the sun <i>will</i> we do,
Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not give up our plan of getting to Paris, for one
thing,&rdquo; replied the leader firmly, with that determined
look on his face the others knew so well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the stuff
I like to hear! <i>Nil desperandum</i> it is, Bumpus, and
we&rsquo;ll carry it out on that line if it takes all the balance
of the summer. Grant said that, but any fellow
with a backbone can feel it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; continued the practical Thad, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
meaning to skirmish around some more and find out
what can be done. You see, all the passengers have
been pulled out of the carriages. Listen to them babble,
will you? They are mostly French, and as excitable
as wildfire. Everybody wants to get away
from the border here in a hurry. Their dear old
France lies just over yonder, and they&rsquo;re bound to
travel if it has to be on foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my stars!&rdquo; ejaculated Bumpus, and then he
stopped short, remembering that much as he disliked
walking any great distance, he should be the
last one of the quartette to complain now, for it was
his errand that beckoned them on to Paris.</p>
<p>They immediately bestirred themselves. Each fellow
was to mingle with the bustling passengers and
pick up any and all information possible. Since
they knew so little of the language it was hardly
likely that Allan, Bumpus or Giraffe would meet
with much success; but at least they would be doing
their best.</p>
<p>As usual, they depended a great deal on Thad.
He had a happy faculty for doing things; moreover,
in this case, he was better fitted for catching
snatches of conversation on the part of the voluble
French people than any one of his comrades.</p>
<p>About ten minutes later Thad made signals to his
chums, on catching their eyes, bidding them join
him. This they did only too gladly, for up to that
moment none of the trio had learned anything worth
mentioning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be all right, I guess,&rdquo; Thad told them
first of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve heard of a train we can take, eh?&rdquo;
queried Bumpus eagerly, while a thankful glow began
to appear in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;it seems there&rsquo;s another
road tapping this place that leads to Calais, which,
you know, is on the Channel, and the terminus of
a boat line coming from Dover over in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe; &ldquo;and we figured
that since England has butted into this war game she
must be sending her little army across the Channel,
or the Straits of Dover that way, to help her ally
France hold the Kaiser in check.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they have a great need of every kind of
car at Calais, it seems, passenger and freight, to
carry men and munitions from there into the interior.
So there has been made up a long train of
empties that is going to start across country right
away, aiming for Calais. And the railway people
here have made arrangements to carry all those who
want to head that way, if they promise not to kick
at the poor accommodations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, any port in a storm,&rdquo; said Giraffe; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
shut our eyes and go in a cattle van if necessary and
not say a single word.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only too glad of the chance,&rdquo; added Bumpus
gratefully; &ldquo;because once we get to Calais we&rsquo;ll be
out of the line of the invading German army; and it
ought to be a whole lot easier for us to make Paris
from that point than away up here on the border of
Belgium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it would seem so,&rdquo; Thad added, with a
wrinkle across his forehead; as if even at that time
he might be having a faint vision of the terrible difficulties
they were destined to meet later on while
trying to accomplish their object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead us to it, Thad,&rdquo; implored the impatient
Giraffe.</p>
<p>Already they could see that some of the excited
passengers had commenced to move away. The word
was being passed along the line that if they chose to
head for the city on the Channel there was an opportunity
offered, and few, if any, declined the opening,
for they were fairly wild to get deeper into their
native country.</p>
<p>When the four American scouts, a little later on,
found themselves at another station and gazing upon
a long string of traffic vehicles they could not keep
from exchanging smiles.</p>
<p>It certainly looked as though already the sudden
and violent demands made upon all the railways of
Northern France for transportation on account of
the mobilization of the troops, with their batteries,
and horses, had caused a tremendous drain on their
limited resources. They did not have these things
&ldquo;down pat&rdquo; to the minutest detail, as in Germany,
where every man, young and old, knew exactly
what was expected of him when a certain order
went forth, and the whole nation moved like a gigantic
machine, in unison.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>The cars were of a polyglot type. There were a
few &ldquo;carriages&rdquo; as they call the passenger cars
across the sea, some first-class, others descending
the scale rapidly until they reached the lowest depth
of unpainted transportation vehicles, no doubt taken
hurriedly from the repair shops. So long as they
were apparently sound, and would not break down
under a strain, they had been drafted into service.</p>
<p>Besides these there were numerous freight vans,
much shorter than even the ordinary open flat cars
seen on all American railways. Box cars are not
in great use abroad, the goods being covered with
heavy tarpaulins instead.</p>
<p>Already most of the carriages had been reserved
for the women and children. Little did the four
boys care about this. The day was pretty hot, and
the sun beamed down from a clear sky, but they
were well used to this sort of thing, and had no
thought of venturing the first complaint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick out as solid a van as you can find, Thad,&rdquo;
remarked Bumpus, as they started to walk along
this string of antequated traffic carriers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please do,&rdquo; Giraffe chuckled, &ldquo;for the sake
of Bumpus here, who needs to have things good
and strong when he travels. No ordinary coach
will do for a fellow of his heft. How about that
third van, Thad; it looks as if it might be a fair
article?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently the patrol leader thought the same
himself, for he proceeded to climb aboard, after
tossing his bag and other &ldquo;duffle&rdquo; ahead of him.
The others copied his example without delay. Men
were boarding the train all along the line, picking
out their locations as the whim moved them. There
was more or less laughter, and no doubt they joked
with one another in their native tongue; for never
before had the majority ever deigned to travel upon
cattle and goods vans.</p>
<p>Men in uniform bustled around to hasten things.
From this Thad judged that there had a hurry call
come for the means of transportation over at Calais,
where possibly British troops and munitions and batteries
were landing daily, and must be taken to the
front in haste, for the German invasion threatened
Paris by now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we go,&rdquo; sang out Giraffe, presently; &ldquo;that
must have been the signal from the man in the
motor ahead, to start the string moving. Yes, we&rsquo;re
off at last, and over the border in France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus had managed to settle himself upon his
bag, and was looking fairly comfortable, though
that anxious expression did not leave his round face
entirely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>The long and singularly mixed train pulled out
of the border town. People waved after it, for
there was such a tingle of excitement in the air these
days all over the land that few could settle down
to doing any ordinary business. The younger men
had rushed off to mobilization centres, and were
even now fighting valiantly on the front line, in the
endeavor to delay the forward push of the Teuton
host, until the defences of Paris could be strengthened.
And while the hearts of fathers and mothers
went out to the boys in the French army in blue, at
this early stage of the great war they did not doubt
but that the invaders would be soon driven back to
their Northern country.</p>
<p>While at the border town Giraffe had particularly
noticed a man whom he vowed paid unusual attention
to them. A number of times the boy had declared
the other hung around as though trying to
listen to what they might be saying. And really
Allan himself confessed that the mysterious fellow
did have some of the ear-marks of a spy, or secret
agent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Giraffe had made up his mind about that. He
vowed the other was a German spy who foolishly
believed they must be English boys, and was watching
them for some strange purpose. In support of
this rather wild statement, Giraffe had even stated
that it was already well known how the Germans had
planted a host of secret agents all over Belgium and
Northern France. Many of these people had lived
there for a long term of years, and were in daily
touch with their neighbors, picking up all manner
of valuable information, which was regularly and
systematically forwarded to Headquarters at Berlin,
to be entered in ponderous volumes in the archives
of the Secret Service, and to be used in event
of war.</p>
<p>Every now and then Giraffe would refer to this
unknown party. He seemed unable to get the other
out of his mind; but then that was Giraffe&rsquo;s usual
way; for once he formed an opinion he always displayed
extraordinary obstinacy in sticking to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope that skulker got left at the post, and
didn&rsquo;t make up his mind to go to Calais to find out
what was happening there,&rdquo; he was saying, after
taking a good look over their fellow passengers on
the van, and failing to discover any sign of the
unwelcome one.</p>
<p>Thad and Allan watched the shifting scenery, and
commented on its similarity to the Belgian canal
country through which they had passed below Antwerp,
only that now they met with occasional low
hills, and there were times when the motor seemed
to be put to its best &ldquo;licks,&rdquo; as Allan called it, in
order to carry the long train over a rise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Bumpus still sat there, balancing on his luggage,
and possibly trying to count the miles as they were
left behind. Whenever he raised his eyes to look
steadily toward the southeast there appeared a wistful
expression in their depths that did credit to the
boy&rsquo;s faithful heart; because he must be thinking
just then of the mother he loved, and how she would
be eagerly awaiting his arrival in the French capital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming to another climb, it looks like,
Thad,&rdquo; remarked Allan about this time, as he
pointed ahead, and to one side.</p>
<p>The road made something of a bend in order to
strike the hill at its lowest point, and consequently
they could see what lay before them. Just as Allan
had said, the train was soon slowly and laboriously
ascending the grade. Giraffe became interested, and
soon expressed the opinion that the little motor
would have all it could do to drag that heavy train
over the crown of the rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; he added thoughtfully, &ldquo;they seem to have
enormous power for such baby engines compared
with our big machines, and I guess we&rsquo;ll make the
riffle in decent shape. I&rsquo;d hate to get stuck here on
the slope, and have to wait for help to come along
so as to push or pull us to the top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had hardly said this when the boys felt a sudden
slackening of the motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! look there, will you?&rdquo; almost shouted Giraffe,
jumping to his feet. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s busted, and
the train is going on without these four last vans.
There, we&rsquo;ve commenced to start back down the
slope again; and say, it&rsquo;s too late to jump off!
Everybody hold fast, and set your teeth for the
worst!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">GIRAFFE ON GUARD</span></h2>
<p>While Giraffe was saying this the remnant of
the train was indeed attaining considerable velocity
in its backward rush. Thad knew that a coupling
must have broken under the great strain, a no infrequent
occurrence across in America.</p>
<p>Of course by now a pandemonium of loud cries
and shrieks had broken forth. Some of the more
excitable passengers aboard the rear vans acted as
though almost ready to hurl themselves out of the
open vehicles of transportation. Indeed, Thad just
caught one frightened little boy in time to prevent
him from jumping wildly.</p>
<p>There was a guard&rsquo;s van at the extreme rear, and
the man in this must have immediately guessed the
nature of the accident. Perhaps he had prepared
against such a thing, knowing that it was liable to
happen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>At any rate he seemed to have some means for
putting on the brakes, for while they continued to
slip rather swiftly down the grade their progress
was not anything like it would have been had the
wheels turned unimpeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, and nothing is going to happen to
hurt us!&rdquo; called Thad, as he held the struggling
French lad fast, despite his efforts to break away.</p>
<p>Although few of those who heard what he said
may have exactly understood what the American
scout meant, at least his actions were reassuring,
and they could comprehend the fact that he must
be discounting the danger that menaced them. Then
besides they also discovered for themselves that they
were not whirling madly down to destruction, as
they had at first anticipated would be the case.</p>
<p>Reaching the bottom of the slope the action of
the brakes became more pronounced, and presently
the fragment of the mixed train came to a stop at
the bend. Already had the man in the motor been
informed of the disaster that had happened. By
looking up the boys could see that the train was
backing down toward them.</p>
<p>Everybody breathed easy again. Faces that had
turned ghastly white now burned red with the reaction.
Some even laughed hysterically, and of course
boldly disclaimed anything in the nature of fear. It
is always so after the cause of alarm has been effectually
dissipated, for people are pretty much alike
all over the civilized world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Giraffe was rubbing his chin, while a shrewd expression
stole gradually over his lean and suspicious
face. Bumpus was puffing with the excitement, and
as red as he could well be. He looked over the
edge of the van at the hard ground, with the air
of one who might be figuring on how it would feel
to be tossed out, and flung on that unfriendly soil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only another little incident in our career over
here,&rdquo; remarked Allan, as though by now they ought
to be pretty well accustomed to having thrilling
events turn up every little while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, are you <i>quite</i> sure it was just an accident?&rdquo;
asked Giraffe, at which remark all the
others immediately turned their eyes on the speaker
in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s bothering you, Giraffe?&rdquo; spluttered Bumpus,
always the slowest to size up a situation when
quickness of thought was an asset. &ldquo;Course a coupling
broke and let us slip backwards. It often happens
around our part of the country, where the
trains have to pull over hills. I&rsquo;ve seen a coal train
dumped in a hollow because of a defective iron
coupling pin. And we&rsquo;re the luckiest fellows going,
in the bargain, to have escaped a smash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Giraffe only wagged that head of his, poised
on the longest neck any boy in Cranford could boast,
and looked mysterious. Even the way he turned
his eyes to the right and to the left added to his
solemn manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go on and tell us what ails you, Giraffe, that&rsquo;s
a decent fellow,&rdquo; urged Allan Hollister, understanding
that unless some one hurried the other along he
would keep everlastingly at this business of looking
so &ldquo;knowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; began the tall scout, in a low hoarse
tone that he tried to make impressive, &ldquo;I believe it
wasn&rsquo;t an accident at all, but a deliberate and dastardly
attempt at wrecking the train!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whee! who&rsquo;d want to bother trying to smash
such a collection of old traps as these carriages and
goods vans are, tell me?&rdquo; wheezed Bumpus. &ldquo;You
must be dreaming, Giraffe, that&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe I am, Bumpus, mebbe I am,&rdquo; muttered
the other, as he watched the coming of the front
part of the long train, &ldquo;but all the same I&rsquo;ve got a
hunch that there&rsquo;s something crooked about this
thing. You ask who&rsquo;d want to bother making
kindling-wood of these lovely cars? Well, that German
spy I warned you about, for one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at them triumphantly as he said this.
Allan and Thad exchanged glances, though it was
hard to tell whether they had been duly impressed
or not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you see, fellows,&rdquo; the artful Giraffe
went on to say, following up his attack while the
&ldquo;iron was hot,&rdquo; and Bumpus at least was thrilled;
&ldquo;even such a makeshift train as this is going to be
mighty useful to the French, for it&rsquo;ll get a pack of
British soldiers to the fighting line much sooner
than if they had to walk all the way across country.
So wouldn&rsquo;t it pay a real cunning secret agent of
the Kaiser to plot so as to smash things? Why, if
he could cause a wreck, and put the old line out of
business for twenty-four hours it would count something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it does look like that might be so,&rdquo; admitted
Bumpus; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t hardly believe any man
would put so many innocent lives in danger just to
hold back a few cars and vans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is <i>war</i>, and we&rsquo;ve already learned that
Germans never hesitate at anything terrible if only
they can serve the Fatherland,&rdquo; Giraffe finished
triumphantly.</p>
<p>However, neither Thad nor Allan seemed to be
convinced. The former even jumped off and went
forward to where some of the men were clustered,
endeavoring to repair the damages so that the reunited
train could proceed once more. When later
on he came back again, it was to tell the others that
all was serene, and they were about to proceed,
which they soon found to be the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear anything said about trickery,
Thad?&rdquo; demanded Giraffe, after the hill had been
successfully negotiated, and they were once more
gliding along at an accelerated pace, perhaps to make
up for lost time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a single word,&rdquo; the other told him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, even that doesn&rsquo;t prove that the thing
wasn&rsquo;t a set-up job,&rdquo; complained the stubborn Giraffe.
&ldquo;That rascal could cover his work, and make
it appear as though it had happened by accident.
They&rsquo;re mighty sly, let me tell you. And I glimpsed
him moving about among the people when repairs
were being made. Yes, and he even seemed to be
having a hand in the work, which I take it was only
done to throw off suspicion. But I&rsquo;m watching him,
don&rsquo;t you forget that. Giraffe&rsquo;s right on the job.
Sooner or later I calculate to trip that spy up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad was used to hearing the other talk in that
strain, for Giraffe invariably went in for things
with all his heart and soul. That in a measure
accounted for his success in many games in which
he took part; and his vim covered up a multitude of
minor shortcomings, according to Thad&rsquo;s way of
looking at it.</p>
<p>Of course what the suspicious one had said was
not entirely without the bounds of reason. Thad
knew that German spies were circulating through
Belgium and Northern France by thousands, and
taking all sorts of desperate chances in order to do
something for their native land. Many of them
lived amidst people who had known and respected
them for years; and they even carried on extensive
business enterprises; but these were only masks for
the real reason that kept them exiles from home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>There were no signs of war in the country through
which they were now passing, except now and then
they glimpsed some man in uniform guarding a
bridge. Women, to be sure, were busily engaged
caring for the growing crops in the fields; but then
in times of peace that is a common sight through
most European countries, where they do much of
the farm and garden work, while the men go to
town with the produce, carry on the voting, and
&ldquo;boss things generally, as our American Indians
used to do,&rdquo; Giraffe had more than once remarked
when noticing these things.</p>
<p>In a town they came to, however, there were more
stirring sights awaiting them. A regiment was
being embarked on a train bound for the front,
though just why it had been delayed so long of
course the boys never knew. It was a martial spectacle
indeed, and one they would often look back
to with a thrill. The men were bidding their wives,
children, or sweethearts goodbye, well knowing that
many of them would never look on those dear faces
again.</p>
<p>Those aboard the patched-up train took a deep
interest in the going of the reserves to where duty
and honor, perhaps a soldier&rsquo;s grave, awaited them.
Being detained on account of the other train that
was lying across their track, they could watch all
that went on. And when finally it moved off, amidst
loud huzzas, and frantic waving of handkerchiefs
together with a flood of tender farewells, every one
joined in the thrilling shouts, even the four American
boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Such sights were bound to make a lasting impression
on the minds of the young scouts. In
years to come they would surely remember them, and
in imagination once more see the waving hands, the
anxious tear-wet faces of girls and women and children,
not to mention the old men; and note how
those aboard the departing troop train thrust their
hands far out from the windows of the carriages
so as to get the very last glimpse of the ones left
behind.</p>
<p>But it was over at last. The loaded train bearing
brave hearts and valiant souls devoted to the
defense of their beloved country had vanished, and
those who were bound for Calais could now once
more proceed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How few of them may ever see their folks
again,&rdquo; said Bumpus, shaking his head sadly; &ldquo;for
we happen to know how men are mowed down like
ripe grain before those terrible guns of the Germans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s always been going on that way,&rdquo;
added Giraffe, who could survey such things without
feeling so &ldquo;squeamish&rdquo; as tender-hearted Bumpus,
&ldquo;since the time this world began. Men and animals
keep on scrapping, and it&rsquo;ll be the same to the end of
time. Men must fight, and women must weep. But
if the women get the vote mebbe they&rsquo;ll want to do
some of the scrapping themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>They understood that by now they were getting
well along on their journey, and also if everything
went smoothly, in another half-hour or so the slow-moving
mixed train could be expected to pull into
the seaport whither it was bound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then a whole lot depends on whether we can get
transportation to Paris,&rdquo; Bumpus was telling them,
as they discussed this matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cross a bridge till you come to the same,&rdquo;
warned Giraffe, always confident. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find a way
to get there, make your mind easy, Bumpus. We
always do, you know, and that isn&rsquo;t bragging, either,
only telling bald facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the train slackened its speed as though
signalled to pull up at the next station, where there
was another big crowd awaiting it, perhaps some of
whom meant to go on to Calais so as to get across
the Channel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stop here for ten minutes, I heard a guard
say,&rdquo; observed Thad; &ldquo;so if any of you feel like
stretching your legs, now&rsquo;s the time to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only Allan took advantage of the opportunity, besides
the scout leader. Giraffe and Bumpus continued
to sit there and watch all that was going on,
at the same time keeping track of such luggage as
they possessed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Giraffe amused himself in trying to mentally figure
out what each queer person he chanced to pick
out of the jostling throng might be when at home.
It was a favorite game with the tall scout, for he
had the habit of observation highly developed, as
many scouts do, since it grows upon one.</p>
<p>In the midst of his occupation Giraffe received a
sudden, violent shock. It really affected him so that
he seized Bumpus by the arm and gave that worthy
a duplicate thrill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, wouldn&rsquo;t that jar you now, Bumpus?&rdquo; was
what Giraffe burst out with. &ldquo;If you please, there&rsquo;s
our chums talking to beat the band with a <i>man</i>;
and what do you think, it&rsquo;s that crafty German spy.
Now what does that mean, I&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">AT CALAIS, ON THE CHANNEL</span></h2>
<p>Of course, Bumpus was duly impressed with the
amazing fact. He sat up and craned his neck in
imitation of Giraffe, as well as the difference in their
build permitted. Sure enough, the two boys were
seen earnestly talking with a man; and just as the
watchful Giraffe had declared, he did look a bit mysterious
when one came to remember the surrounding
circumstances.</p>
<p>But Thad and Allan seemed to have no fear. In
fact, they were apparently on very good terms with
the other, for while Giraffe looked he saw the man
actually shake hands with each in turn, as though he
had some reason to be grateful to them.</p>
<p>Well, Giraffe could stand it no longer. He feared
some gigantic catastrophe must be threatening the
safety of his chums, and that it was high time he
hastened to their relief.</p>
<p>Accordingly, he told Bumpus to &ldquo;sit tight&rdquo; and
watch their luggage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bound to find out what all this means, don&rsquo;t
you see?&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go to it, Giraffe; and don&rsquo;t let that fellow kidnap
our chums,&rdquo; Bumpus told him; and possibly there
was a slight vein of sarcasm in the manner of the
speaker, though, as a rule, Bumpus was not given
to making cutting remarks.</p>
<p>Giraffe quickly joined the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you came, Giraffe,&rdquo; said Allan, &ldquo;for you&rsquo;re
just in time to chin in and help a chap in distress.
Come, pony up a dollar, and it&rsquo;ll square the account,
both Thad and myself have hit that amount apiece,
and he needs three to get back home again from
Calais.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-w-why, w-what&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo; gasped Giraffe,
almost stunned when he saw all his wonderful castles
in the air connected with stealthy German spies
tumbling to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing out of the way,&rdquo; explained Thad with
a smile, for he understood that Giraffe was up
against the fence and pretty nearly &ldquo;all in.&rdquo; &ldquo;You
see, this gentleman is Mr. Algernon Smikes. He&rsquo;s
a commercial traveler from London, who, like some
other people, chanced to be caught abroad when the
war broke out, and has been having a hard time
trying to get back to Old England. He&rsquo;s shown us
letters to prove all he says, too; so there&rsquo;s no doubt
about it. His money has run low because of the
many delays; and thinking that we were English
fellows, he ventured to speak to us. We&rsquo;ve set him
straight about our nationality; but at the same time
loaned him eight francs, which he will return when
he gets back home again. How about you helping
him out, Giraffe?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Thereupon the drummer started in to beg that
Giraffe would pardon him for playing such a contemptible
role as that of a &ldquo;beggar,&rdquo; something he
had never done before in all his life; but the conditions
were remarkable, and he did not know how
else he could make the home port.</p>
<p>When Giraffe heard him speak he knew instantly
that his suspicions had been altogether unfounded,
for no German spy could ever assume that cockney
brogue. Of course, when he thought the man was
watching them in the capacity of a secret agent,
he had been only trying to pick up courage enough to
&ldquo;touch&rdquo; them for a small loan, under the impression
that they were also English.</p>
<p>So Giraffe, without a murmur, took out some
money and handed it to the other. He probably
thought he owed Algernon that much for having
so unjustly suspected him of espionage when the
poor drummer was only worrying about his inability
to cross the Channel after reaching Calais.</p>
<p>They had no further time for engaging in conversation,
because the cry went out that the train
was about to start. So the boys hastened to join
Bumpus, who, in turn, must be told how the &ldquo;suspect&rdquo;
had turned out to be a most innocent chap
indeed. Bumpus grinned a little, upon seeing which
Giraffe, with his face much redder than usual, tried
to defend his blunder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said, stoutly; &ldquo;and I acknowledge
the corn. I <i>was</i> mistaken, but, then, nobody
can be perfect. I saw my duty, and I did it.
Who&rsquo;s got any fault to find with that policy, tell
me? A scout must always keep his eyes open and
see what&rsquo;s going on around him. And he oughtn&rsquo;t
to take things for granted, either. Better to make
ten mistakes than to overlook something important
just once. And now let&rsquo;s forget all about it. A
dollar was a small sum to pay for such an experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently the lanky chum did not mean to alter
his ways, for he was very stubborn, and often remarked
that a &ldquo;giraffe can&rsquo;t change his spots any
more than a leopard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, they were once more moving along at a fair
speed and heading for Calais, on the coast. Allan
said it could not be far away, because he could
surely detect something like salt air when he sniffed
in a knowing way; and the others agreed that this
was a fact.</p>
<p>In due time they arrived at Calais. Even before
entering the city they could understand that it was
altered from the old Calais, where the most exciting
events of the day used to be the docking of the over-Channel
steamer from London and the arrival and
departure of the Paris trains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>It was well along in the afternoon. All sorts of
whistles could be heard, as if an unusual number of
motors on the railway might be switching and making
up extra trains for transporting the troops and
batteries and munitions that kept arriving from
across the Channel in increasing quantities.</p>
<p>They were soon in the bustle, and it thrilled them
to actually see the khaki uniforms of the British
&ldquo;Tommies&rdquo; everywhere. Up to now, in their wanderings
over a part of Belgium, they had never
happened to come across any of King George&rsquo;s soldiers,
for the very good reason that none were to be
found in that region. But apparently a constant
stream must be coming over to join hands with the
French in trying to save Paris from the invading
host.</p>
<p>Of course all the boys were intensely interested
in the wonderful sights they saw on every hand.
They drank them in eagerly, and Bumpus was round-eyed
with a greedy avidity as he tried to watch both
sides of the street while they were going to find a
hotel.</p>
<p>At the same time, Thad did not mean to neglect
their own mission, although realizing more than ever
the stupendous difficulties that were bound to confront
them as soon as they tried to find a means
for reaching Paris.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Of course every train that pulled out would be
filled to overflowing with troops, and if there
chanced to be room for any regular passengers those
who lived in the French capital would be favored
first of all.</p>
<p>Excitement filled the air. Music could be heard,
for soldiers will show a certain amount of gaiety
even though facing a terrible battle on the morrow.
And whichever way one looked it was to see marching
men in khaki. Bumpus reckoned that there must
be thousands of them in Calais.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll need to be many times over what the
British army boasts, to stand up before the millions
of the Kaiser,&rdquo; Giraffe told him; for, as may be
remembered, he had a strain of that same Teuton
blood in his veins himself, though claiming to be
American to the backbone.</p>
<p>They were fortunate enough to find lodging in a
private house, for the hotels could not accommodate
another person, being filled to overflowing. When
this had been finally accomplished Thad and Allan
left the others and sauntered out to discover what
chance there was of the journey to Paris being carried
through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>They were not long in determining that nothing
could be done, that day at least. Bumpus would be
grievously disappointed, but it could not be helped.
Lots of other folks besides the four chums were
being held up there and unable to reach their intended
destinations, and Thad soon learned that
many of these people were burning with anxiety,
since their homes lay directly along the path taken
by the German army in making for Paris. Of
course they pictured the most terrible things as coming
to pass, so the two boys agreed that at least
they had something to be thankful for.</p>
<p>They did manage to find a little encouragement,
and this led them to hope they might get away on
the following morning. A train would be pulling
out, and unless another boat came in meanwhile,
laden with fresh troops, there might be room for
them.</p>
<p>That was a very long night to poor Bumpus. And
what made it even worse was the fact that they heard
how many thousands of people were quitting the
French capital by every sort of conveyance, anticipating
that the Germans would soon be surrounding
Paris, and another terrible siege would be on like
that of &rsquo;71. Even the official headquarters and
members of the National Legislature had gone south
so as to prepare for the worst. And there would
always be a possibility that Mrs. Hawtree might have
accompanied the staff of the sanitarium to some city
in the south of France.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>With the coming of morning the boys were astir.
Hardly waiting to devour a hasty breakfast, Thad
and Allan, together with Giraffe this time, set out
to ascertain what the chances might be for an early
departure. Luck was with them, since they managed
to book for the capital, though duly warned that the
train might have to be abandoned long before it
reached its intended destination, since one of the
three great tidal waves of invaders was said to be
threatening communications by way of that very
line.</p>
<p>A little thing like that could not deter the boys,
and, accordingly, when the train pulled out on schedule
time, they were aboard, with Bumpus exceedingly
hopeful, though at times also given to serious doubts.</p>
<p>Every mile passed over they knew was taking
them closer to where the two hostile armies were
maneuvring, each trying to flank the other and
gain some decided advantage. At every stop on the
way Giraffe could be seen thrusting his head out of
the window and evidently straining his hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost dead sure I could catch a queer distant
rumbling sound when the little wind there is
came from out of the southeast,&rdquo; he remarked after
one of these occasions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it may have been thunder or big guns
working, don&rsquo;t you, Giraffe?&rdquo; asked Bumpus, deeply
interested himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some sort of a battle on, as sure as you
live!&rdquo; declared the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Thad knew he spoke the truth, for he, too, had
caught that same low mutter that could mean only
one thing, for there was not a cloud in the sky to
tell of rain. From the hour the Kaiser&rsquo;s hosts had
crossed the French border there had started a series
of earth quakings that would never cease as long
as one invader&rsquo;s foot remained on French soil, no
matter if it took years to eject them.</p>
<p>Some time later the train came to a small village
and stopped. The boys quickly realized that something
had happened, for the guards came along telling
the passengers to alight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We dare go no further,&rdquo; Thad told his comrades
after listening to what was being said by the chattering
throng. &ldquo;It seems that they&rsquo;ve got word a
portion of one of the great divisions of the German
army is overrunning the line ahead of us. It
is no longer possible to get to Paris this way. We
are just a day too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus was tugging at Thad&rsquo;s sleeve immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do we have to give it up altogether, Thad?&rdquo;
he asked in a quivering voice. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there some sort
of way in which we might get around the Germans
and come in on Paris from the southwest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can do our level best and try,&rdquo; the
other assured him. &ldquo;You know we&rsquo;ve never been
the fellows to give up anything easily, Bumpus. So
let&rsquo;s hustle around to see what sort of conveyance
we can strike. And as beggars shouldn&rsquo;t be choosers
we&rsquo;ll be glad to take whatever comes along.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">CAUGHT BETWEEN THE LINES</span></h2>
<p>Concerning one thing, at least, there was no
longer any doubt. They could plainly hear the deep
grumble of big guns, while the very earth under
them trembled perceptibly with the tremendous shock
of the explosions that were miles away.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the battle was on that must decide
the fate of the gay French capital. Von Kluck and
those other daring Teuton commanders were converging
in toward Paris just as the spokes of a
giant wheel draw closer as they approach the hub.
If General Joffre, the veteran French leader, could
manage through strategy to baffle their designs he
would win such immortal fame as no man short of
Napoleon had ever attained in the estimation of
the French nation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>The boys hunted high and low for some means
of transportation. Others were doing the same
thing, white of face, as they listened to those dreadful
sounds. For aught some of these people knew
tens of thousands of Germans might be covering
the roads in that section of the country where their
beloved homes lay, and their hearts were filled with
dire forebodings whenever they thought of the innocent
ones toward whom they were endeavoring to
hasten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re mighty lucky to get even this ricketty old
rig!&rdquo; Allan declared as Bumpus and Giraffe were
mounting to seats in the wagon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll help us on
our way some miles, and when the horse lays down
on us, why we&rsquo;ll be that much closer to Paris. Then
walking is good in the bargain, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll agree to try anything you say, fellows!&rdquo;
Bumpus groaned, &ldquo;if only it promises to help things
along. We must manage to get there by hook or
by crook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were duly warned concerning the chances of
meeting with detachments of the enemy while on
the road; since it must be taken for granted that the
moving army would have skirmishers and cavalry
forces guarding its flanks, so that the French might
not execute a brilliant flank attack and throw the
main line into temporary confusion.</p>
<p>It was all very thrilling, especially when they
could constantly hear the rumble of artillery far in
the distance. The battle that this marked was being
fought many miles away; but even at that, they had
no reason to believe the country lying between would
be free from the invaders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>To Bumpus their progress was terribly slow.
True, the poor horse did his best under the lash that
the peasant boy in the wooden sabots administered
almost without cessation; but at that it seemed a
snail&rsquo;s pace to the impatient boy.</p>
<p>Giraffe advised him to get out and run ahead if he
felt that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time enough to do that when I have to,&rdquo; Bumpus
retorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m saving myself for an emergency.
And from the way this crowbait keeps stumbling
along I reckon it&rsquo;s going to come to a case of shank&rsquo;s
mare right soon with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad, however, was bent on keeping their seats
just as long as they could. There would be plenty
of time for walking when they were forced to that
extremity. And he had found other things to attract
his attention in the bargain.</p>
<p>Once, when they chanced to be passing over a little
rise, he discovered a moving mass of men a
couple of miles away. The sun glinted from their
accoutrements and disclosed the fact that they must
be marching soldiers. When he called the attention
of the others to that particular quarter Giraffe, who
had extra strong eyesight, immediately declared they
were German soldiers without doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could tell the French blue right away if I saw
it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Those men are wearing a sort of
greenish-gray uniform, the same as we saw on the
Germans up in Belgium when we were trying to
make Antwerp. Yes, and they&rsquo;ve got those odd
spiked helmets on that only the Germans fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>The alarming fact that they were now so very close
to the oncoming invading army gave them all a new
thrill. Even the peasant boy stared at the vision,
and looked as though almost heart-broken; for he
had doubtless heard terrible stories connected with
that other raid through his beloved France, long
before he was born, and, of course, he could only
fear the worst.</p>
<p>As their road seemed to turn somewhat toward
the south just there the boys determined to go on,
trusting to luck to see them through. At the worst,
if they did come in contact with any troop of raiding
Uhlans, they could fall back on the fact of being
Americans, and perhaps manage to pass muster.</p>
<p>Among themselves they talked it over as the boy
continued to beat the horse and cause him to keep
jogging along the winding road. It was soon decided
that the moving stream of men they had
glimpsed could not belong to the corps that was engaged
so fiercely in battle with the Allies defending
the approaches to Paris. They must be another section
entirely, heading so as to attack the forts around
Paris from the west. And it turned out later on
just as they had figured, so that the boys could plume
themselves on their sagacity.</p>
<p>Just a quarter of an hour afterward Giraffe uttered
a cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this I see away over yonder, fellows?&rdquo;
he called out, pointing as he spoke. &ldquo;Another army
in motion and heading so as to come smack up
against those chaps in the gray-green uniforms. But
say, these troops are in the French blue. Bully for
them, they are meaning to make it hot for the Kaiser
when he tries to sneak into Paris by the back door.
It&rsquo;s true some of my folks did come from that same
Rhine country a long while ago, but now I&rsquo;m backing
the under dog in the fight, and somehow my sympathies
seem to be with poor France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see here, how about us?&rdquo; ejaculated Bumpus.
&ldquo;Suppose those two armies get to smashing away
at each other and with four boys caught between
the lines? If that happens, wouldn&rsquo;t we be apt to
find ourselves in a pickle enough? I guess we&rsquo;d
better be looking around for a hiding place. And
a deep cyclone cellar&rsquo;d just about suit me right
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t go back if we wanted to,&rdquo; announced
Thad, decisively, &ldquo;because the Germans
must have swarmed across the road a few miles over
there where we came from. And so far as I can
see, there isn&rsquo;t much chance of our hiding around
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horse was showing positive signs of giving
out. Indeed, the peasant boy had used his whip up
in urging the beast on, and, moreover, he could
hardly lift his own arm to ply it any longer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Seeing this, Thad decided that the critical moment
had come. They must abandon the wagon
and most of their luggage, which latter happened to
be exceedingly limited, for by degrees they had gotten
rid of most of their things ere this.</p>
<p>When necessity drives there is no use complaining,
and these scouts had been through so much in
the time they were comrades that by now they could
meet an emergency without a grumble. Even Bumpus
refrained from complaining. He knew Thad
could be depended on to do the very best for them.
There must always be a way out of a difficulty if
only a fellow was smart enough to find it; and Thad
had that happy faculty highly developed.</p>
<p>So they paid off the peasant boy and advised him
to start back toward home, even though he might
be detained a long time on the road. Once they
found themselves afoot again the four boys started
off bravely, each carrying a share of what luggage
they wished to keep, if it could be managed.</p>
<p>The one hope they hugged to their hearts was that
they might come in contact with the advancing
French forces rather than be overwhelmed by the
Germans. In case the former came about they had
arranged their plan of action, meaning to ask only
the liberty of keeping on toward Paris, skirting the
crowded road and making progress toward their
destination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>It struck Thad that the noise of the cannon had
grown much louder. This would appear to indicate
that the range of the battle must be spreading; also,
that it was coming nearer and nearer all the time
as fresh detachments took up the fight.</p>
<p>Giraffe sniffed now and then, very much like a
war-horse scenting battle-smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it certainly does smell like burnt powder,
believe me, fellows,&rdquo; he told his chums. &ldquo;You can
see that the breeze sets from that direction, which
is why we hear the guns so plainly. Whee! but
there must be heaps of exciting events happening
right now, and I&rsquo;d give something to be able to
glimpse the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strange to say, the others were feeling more or
less in the same mood. It must be in the blood for
human beings to wish to gaze upon terrible scenes
of carnage and valor; for no one had before this
ever accused either Thad or Allan of being the
possessor of a blood-thirsty spirit. They just realized
that history was being made close to them, and
that scenes were being enacted every hour that would
in future days be immortalized by some skilful
painter with his brush. And they were, after all,
boys with inquiring minds, as well as having a fair
amount of curiosity in their make-up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>It must have been a great temptation, and they
surrendered to its wiles. Besides, there was really
nothing for them but to either go on or stand still;
and no matter which they decided to do, the end
would likely be the same. If they were caught between
the lines they could hardly expect to get out
of the jaws of the trap without seeing something of
the conflict that hung in the balance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Bumpus when there
came a peculiarly sharp crash not more than half
a mile away from them; &ldquo;was that an exploding
shell, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what it was,&rdquo; asserted Giraffe promptly.
&ldquo;Which shows that things are closing in on us right
smart, as our Southern chum, Bob White Quail,
would say if he was along now. And, what&rsquo;s more,
we&rsquo;ll be hearing a lot of the same before we get
out of this neck of the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus had reason for looking worried. He
knew what a terrible amount of damage an exploding
shell might accomplish, even when it came from
only an ordinary field battery, and he had no wish
to offer his pudgy form as a target for the gunner.</p>
<p>They hurried along the road, hoping every minute
that a turn would disclose the presence of men
in the French blue. A second crash did not make
Bumpus feel any more cheerful, especially since this
detonation came from still another quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose they&rsquo;ve glimpsed us and are
trying to drop one of those horrible shells right in
our midst?&rdquo; he asked Thad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Before the scout leader could make any reply
there was a sudden wild burst of cannonading from
a point close by. Thad guessed the truth at once
as if by some instinct. Evidently there must be
an advanced French field battery secreted in the
region, where it commanded the road over which
the Germans were thronging, and this had commenced
action. Those several German shells had
been dropped just to disclose the position of this
battery; its presence being suspected, thanks to some
air scout who had passed over previously and communicated
the facts to the invading general.</p>
<p>A tremendous din quickly broke out. Guns were
fired by the dozen, and the crash of bursting bombs
almost deafened the four hurrying boys.</p>
<p>They had good reason to hasten their steps, for
to the right and to the left the shells exploded. One
tore a great hole in the roadway not a hundred
yards in front of them, causing the stones and dirt
to fly in every direction.</p>
<p>It was almost impossible to know which way to
turn, and as for finding a place of refuge, that
was utterly out of the question. There did not seem
to be a rod of territory that those searching shells
might not fall upon. One place was just as safe
as another, since it was all a matter of luck. So
Thad kept them on the move, huddled in as small a
compass as possible, with the idea of presenting as
minute a target to the rain of bombs as they could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; yelled Giraffe as they ran along, with
Bumpus puffing like a winded horse dragging a load
up hill, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re coming right now&mdash;the French
battery, I mean. Got too hot for &rsquo;em where they
were, and they&rsquo;re on the jump for safer quarters.
Thad, if we get half a chance, let&rsquo;s try to hook on
to some ammunition caisson! Anything to give
those shells the slip! And there the guns come with
a whirl!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">A NARROW ESCAPE</span></h2>
<p>It was an inspiring spectacle. The French field
battery had done its utmost to inflict more or less
damage upon the advancing German hosts, but evidently
the time had come for discretion to take the
part of desperate valor.</p>
<p>They had no orders to stick it out until every gun
was smashed or the enemy had come swarming up
to bayonet each reckless gunner. &ldquo;Those who fight
and run away may live to fight another day&rdquo;; and
the policy of these clever Frenchmen was to pester
and annoy the oncoming invaders as much as possible
in order to delay their progress, since every
hour counted in the gathering of a force to defend
Paris.</p>
<p>The boys hastened to step aside in order to let the
galloping horses and the swinging guns and caissons
sweep past. Bumpus looked at the wild way in
which they were hastening along the dusty road and
gave it up. It would take a much better athlete than
he professed to be to manage such a thing as boarding
one of those hurrying guns, even though they
were invited to climb aboard. If the others tried it
he, Bumpus, would have to keep going afoot, that
was all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>But of course Thad had no such scheme in his
mind.... Far in the rear he had sighted a caisson
on which there was but a lone Frenchman. Doubtless
his companion must have met with some catastrophe,
one of the bursting shells having &ldquo;got him&rdquo;
in the wild flight.</p>
<p>The horses drawing this caisson did not seem
capable of equalling the speed displayed by the other
animals. Perhaps they, too, had suffered from particles
of a bursting bomb, and, being sorely wounded,
they could not exert their customary strength.</p>
<p>The man was using a whip vigorously. Apparently
he did not fancy being left in the lurch by his
mates, nor could it be pleasant to have all those explosions
taking place so near by.</p>
<p>Thad believed he saw a small chance, if only the
driver displayed heart enough to stop and allow poor
Bumpus to climb aboard. He meant to do all in
his power to influence the man, and for that purpose
commenced making motions with his hands as the
other drew near.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Of course it did not require any wonderful degree
of sagacity to enable the driver to understand
what was wanted. Anybody would wish to get away
from that region if such a thing were at all possible.
And, being a Frenchman, and a gallant fellow in
the bargain, what did he do but hold his frightened
horses in as he reached the spot where the four boys
stood in a bunch.</p>
<p>He also shouted something at them in French.
They may not have known just what the exact meaning of
the few words were, but understood his generous
act. He was inviting them to get up beside him and
have a ride.</p>
<p>Bumpus almost frantically climbed aboard amidst
much grunting, which, however, could not be heard,
such was the terrific din all around them. And
hardly had he managed to get a seat than the driver
whipped his horses into another mad gallop.</p>
<p><a href="#front" id="rfront">Those boys would never forget that furious race.</a>
It was impressed on their memories after a fashion
that time could not efface. The straining horses,
speeding through the cloud of dust raised by the
other units of the field battery; the detonations of
exploding shells, which still continued to drop around
them as though the unseen German gunners had the
range down to a fraction; the difficulty of keeping
their seats on the jumping caisson&mdash;all these things
conspired to form a species of excitement that kept
their nerves tingling with a constant dread lest
something would suddenly happen to bring about
disaster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Once only through a miracle did they escape from
death. A shell dropped upon the road back of them
not ten seconds after they had passed. Had they
been delayed just that length of time it must have
blown caisson and all aboard into atoms; for, of
course, the ammunition in the chest would also have
exploded.</p>
<p>No one tried to talk, which was somewhat strange
on the part of Giraffe, who always wanted to be
heard. With all that fierce jolting knocking the
wind out of them, even he realized the folly of wasting
any breath.</p>
<p>Besides, it could do no good. They were in a
position where the utmost that was possible would
be to grimly hold on and trust to good fortune
to presently carry them out of range of the German
guns. Perhaps presently, too, they might reach
the advance line of the French army, where they
could hope to find shelter behind the bristling defense
guns.</p>
<p>Down along the dusty road Thad stared. He fancied
that he could see what looked like a covered
bridge crossing some branch of the river. Yes,
now the first gun was starting to pass over it, with
the others, as well as the caissons, following swiftly
behind. And higher rose that billow of dust, betraying
their location to the eyes of the enemy
doubtless through field-glasses and by means of
aerial scouts hovering aloft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Thad saw that one gun was missing, and he discovered
it alongside the road almost at the same
moment. Horses lay there with the shattered carriage
supporting the gun and a human leg protruding
from underneath the mass told of the terrible
fate that had overwhelmed the driver. The second
man was not in sight, and Thad had a suspicion that
he might have been picked up by one of the other
teams in passing.</p>
<p>Bumpus, too, caught a passing glimpse of this
terrible sight, and his face was lacking its customary
rosy hue; still he had as much grit as the next one
when it came down to a showing, and uttered no
sound to indicate his dismay, only clinched his jaws
together and set the muscles of his fat cheeks as if
summoning all his resolution to the fore.</p>
<p>They were now approaching the bridge.</p>
<p>Once across it and there was some hope that they
might find themselves in less peril. Surely there
must be a limit to the range of the guns that were
sending all those bombs around them, and the stream
might mark this. Thad hoped so most certainly, as
he mentally counted the seconds that must elapse before
they could gain the bridge.</p>
<p>The horses did not run as they should, and Thad
knew they had been injured, for there was a perceptible
limp to the gait of both animals. Only that
constant lashing on the part of the driver caused
them to keep going; and even that must fail before
a great while.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>What would happen then he knew not. At the
most, they would find themselves no worse off than
before they were taken aboard the caisson by the
obliging driver. Afoot they would have to seek some
sort of shelter and try to hide until that rain of
shells had ceased.</p>
<p>Several times they had other narrow escapes.
Once Giraffe gave a perceptible start, and Thad saw
him clap a hand to his shoulder. It gave the scout
leader a chill, for he, of course, believed the tall
chum must have received a wound that might prove
more or less serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hit, Giraffe?&rdquo; he shouted in the other&rsquo;s
ear, for the din made talking in ordinary tones utterly
out of the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess it didn&rsquo;t amount to much,&rdquo; came
the reply; &ldquo;but something struck me on the arm.
Still, I can&rsquo;t see any sign of blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad himself took a look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your coat sleeve is torn, Giraffe,&rdquo; he told the
other, &ldquo;and I expect you&rsquo;ve had a wonderfully close
shave of it. You&rsquo;re in great luck, let me tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, it even seemed as if the German gunners
far away were concentrating all their fire upon the
vicinity of that covered bridge across the stream, for
the bursting shells were more numerous than ever.
It would be next door to a miracle if they were
allowed to run the gantlet unscathed. At any second
something might happen, and Thad did not
like to imagine what this was apt to be like.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>It would be only natural if all of the boys realized
just then that they had been overbold in trying to
reach Paris from the northwest instead of going
on down the coast to Boulogne and approaching
from the rear, where they might only have met
swarm of fugitives fleeing from the capital and no
German armies closing in.</p>
<p>Now they were drawing close to the bridge. The
balance of the battery had vanished beyond somewhere.
No doubt they had a place in view where another
stand was likely to be made, with the idea
of again opening fire upon the enemy should he
come within range of their guns.</p>
<p>Looking closely, Thad could see no sign of life
around the bridge, and yet somehow he seemed to
have a queer suspicion that there was something
wrong about it, though if asked he could not have
explained his feeling.</p>
<p>They were so close that in another minute the
staggering horses must have pounded upon the
planks with their hoofs. Then came a staggering
blow. It seemed to stop the advance of the tired
team as though they had suddenly dashed against
a barrier, such was the impact of air.</p>
<p>The bridge, where was it? A bewildering sweep
of smoke and fitful flashes of dimly seen flame; a
rending of planks and beams, many of which rose
high in the air; a terrific din of crashing wood, and
then, only a great gap remained.</p>
<p>The bridge was gone!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">THE DANGEROUS CROSSING</span></h2>
<p>The boys and the driver of the caisson cowered
there and waited until the last fragment had fallen,
either in the water or else ashore. They no longer
had a way open for reaching the opposite bank of
the stream, where possible safety awaited them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! what did it, Thad?&rdquo; broke in Bumpus, when
he was able to find his tongue and lift his shrill
voice to a shriek. &ldquo;Could it have been a shell, do
you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad had his suspicions. He found it hard to believe
that a bursting bomb would do all that damage.
It might injure the bridge in one section and
render it unfit for safe passage; but some unseen
powerful force had apparently lifted the whole structure
and scattered the remnants all around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I believe it was blown up by a planted mine!&rdquo;
he called out in reply to the question Bumpus had
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;By the French, do you mean, Thad?&rdquo; demanded
Giraffe, looking incredulous; &ldquo;but why should they
want to do that, when one of their own batteries
was using the bridge to escape by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Thad went on to say hurriedly,
as he looked around him; &ldquo;like as not they had it
fixed to destroy the bridge when the enemy came
along, and after the battery got across the men in
charge of the electric switch, hidden somewhere
across there, thought the Germans must be in close
pursuit, so they let her go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now we&rsquo;re in a hole!&rdquo; cried Bumpus, involuntarily
ducking his head upon his fat shoulders
as another shell burst not far distant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just got to get across, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; declared
the energetic Giraffe. &ldquo;If there isn&rsquo;t any ford
we&rsquo;ll have to duck and run along the water&rsquo;s edge to
look for some sort of a boat, because swimming
would be a tough job for Bumpus, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no matter what we decide to do,&rdquo; added
Allan just then, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better be getting a move on in
a hurry, because I can see mounted men coming
away back there where the road rises a bit, and
I guess they&rsquo;re some of those hard-riding German
cavalrymen they call Uhlans.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>All of them jumped to the ground. Even the
driver knew that he could not hope to save his
caisson with its contents, and, like the discreet soldier
that he was, he immediately commenced to
throw the ammunition into the stream. If France
might not have the benefit of those shells, he meant
to keep her enemies from profiting through his misfortune,
even though he lingered so long that he
put his own life in peril.</p>
<p>Thad had turned an envious eye upon the stream.
He saw instantly that it was of considerable dimensions,
far too wide to be crossed without a boat of
some sort. It had the looks of a deep river in
the bargain, which fact would prevent such a thing
as their wading to the opposite bank.</p>
<p>On both sides bushes grew, together with scrubby
willows. At a pinch, possibly, the boys might manage
to find some sort of shelter amidst these; but
if anything of a hunt was inaugurated by the German
cavalrymen they must be routed out in short
order. And perhaps the very fact of their being in
the company of the obliging French caisson driver
might cause the Uhlans to consider them foes.</p>
<p>Thad did not like to think of what might follow.
Sometimes rough-riding Uhlans act first and investigate
afterward. Plainly, then, it was much to their
advantage to get across that stream one way or another,
if it could be managed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look for a boat, fellows!&rdquo; was what he snapped
out with his characteristic energy; &ldquo;above, below,
no matter where you can find one. It&rsquo;s our best
move, for we ought to get across here, you know!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>His words gave the others the clue. They commenced
using their eyes, following the short up and
down, and carefully scrutinizing every yard of the
bank. Never before in all their existence had a
boat seemed such a desirable commodity as just
then; new or old, big or small, round-bottom or flat,
little they cared if only it would accommodate four
boys and hold water long enough for them to urge it
to the opposite bank before the dreaded Uhlans
arrived.</p>
<p>Of course Giraffe had the advantage of his three
chums in such a rivalry. That eagle eye of his was
without its peer among the members of the Silver
Fox Patrol, and it did not fail its owner now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad, I see one!&rdquo; he whooped joyously. &ldquo;Come
on, everybody, follow me. It&rsquo;s close by, in the bargain.
I only hope and pray it isn&rsquo;t a knocked-out
affair with a big hole punched in the bottom, that&rsquo;s
what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;some&mdash;oars handy, too!&rdquo; gasped Bumpus,
already a little short of breath after all that
riotous jolting while riding on the bouncing caisson.</p>
<p>While they were racing toward the spot the determined
Frenchman was continuing to carry the
contents of the abandoned caisson toward the water.
He had to go a little distance each time, and this
must have bothered him, for possibly he could not
manage to empty the reservoir before the Uhlans
arrived, which fact would break his heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Meanwhile, Giraffe, being the lightest of foot and
most eager, had managed to reach the spot where
the boat lay, partly visible in the weeds and rushes.
Bumpus, trailing in the rear, listened with his heart
almost in his throat, for he knew that the tall scout
would immediately announce the condition of his
find. Nor was he mistaken in the least with regard
to this, for Giraffe had let out a whoop that had a
ring of exultation in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, boys!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;and here&rsquo;s an
oar and a push-pole all handy in the bargain. Now
let&rsquo;s get the old thing afloat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was certainly no time to lose. Those hard-riding
Uhlans must be bearing down on the spot with
a swoop and apt to arrive within shooting distance
before the boys could manage to make the opposite
side of the stream.</p>
<p>Thad and Allan swooped down, and with Giraffe
handling at least half the burden, they made a combined
rush for the border of the river. Little did
they care that their feet got wet, or that they
stepped in almost to their knees in the endeavor
to launch the boat.</p>
<p>With a great splash it dropped and floated! Giraffe
was in the act of turning so as to speed back
after the oar and pole when he discovered Bumpus
tottering along, bearing them under his arm, while
with the other hand he clutched his grip, as though
he did not mean to let that get away from him if
he could help it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for you, Bumpus; you&rsquo;re the goods, and
a whole yard wide!&rdquo; yelped the excited Giraffe, as
he convoyed the fat chum to the end of the boat and
almost lifted him aboard.</p>
<p>They embarked in a regular scramble. It was
no time for ceremony. The danger was too menacing
to allow of anything but actions based on
intuition rather than careful figuring.</p>
<p>Thad seized the oar and commenced using it with
desperate energy. Giraffe refused to relinquish the
push-pole, although Allan had held out his hand for
the same and gave every evidence of being ready to
devote his surplus energy to the task of finding the
bottom of the river.</p>
<p>So they were actually off at last, and perhaps the
whole effort took much less time than it has required
to tell it. Whether the Uhlans were getting close
or not could only be guessed, because the low bank
of the river prevented them from seeing this fact for
themselves.</p>
<p>Bumpus lay in the stern, just as he had fallen
into the craft. Once Giraffe called out sharply to
the stout comrade and asked him to &ldquo;trim the boat&rdquo;
a little by rolling more to the right, which, of course,
Bumpus only too willingly did. He was ever an
obliging boy and ready to accommodate his friends
on all occasions. Besides, Bumpus realized that he
was having the easy end of the game, just lying there
and letting the others do all the work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Allan was in the bow and had his face turned toward
the shore from which they had just started.
Hence he was in a position to see all that went on
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us when you glimpse &rsquo;em, Allan!&rdquo; wheezed
Giraffe between furious pushes with his pole, while
Thad kept pace by rapid urgings with the oar, which
he was of course using in the nature of a paddle,
since it is impossible to row with only half a pair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see yet awhile, on account of that bank,&rdquo;
Allan called out; &ldquo;but I seem to <i>hear</i> something like
the pounding of horses&rsquo; hoofs, now that the shells
have about stopped coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then his attention was taken up with something
else. The excited Frenchman at the caisson
had changed his mind evidently. He saw that he
could never empty the ammunition cart of all its
contents before the coming of the cavalrymen, and
apparently a new scheme had struck him.</p>
<p>Even as Allan glanced that way he saw the horses
running down along the stream as though they had
been cut free from the caisson by a sharp knife and
then jabbed with the same pointed blade more or less
painfully in order to cause them to dash off. And
there was the driver unwinding something that
looked like a thick black cord, backing away from
the stranded ammunition chest at the same time.</p>
<p>Allan guessed what was in the wind. He did not
need any one to tell him that it was a fuse the driver
handled, and that he meant to lay a trap so as to
blow up the caisson with its valuable contents before
suffering it to fall into the hands of the enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Well, that was no affair of the boys, so long as
they were not struck by any fragment of the exploding
ammunition depot. Allan felt a further touch
of sincere admiration for the valiant French driver
and then turned his attention to their own condition,
which was getting rather desperate, it seemed.</p>
<p>Despite all that Thad could do with his paddle,
supplemented by the energetic use of the push-pole
in the hands of Giraffe, also working like a hero,
the boat did not move along as fast as they would
have liked. It was a clumsy, flat-bottom contraption
and never built for speed. Water was oozing in
through a number of small cracks, and while this
did not threaten them with immediate disaster, at the
same time every gallon that the boat took in added
so much to the weight and delayed their progress
a fraction of time.</p>
<p>Then Allan sighted the oncoming Uhlans. The
spectacle did not add to his hopes, for he could
see that they were scores in number, and that those
in the lead promised to actually reach the shore of
the stream before the boat, at their present rate of
progress, could ever attain the opposite bank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Allan shivered to think what would happen. His
feelings grew even more intense when he discovered,
as he did just then, that some of the hard riders
were already reaching back for the guns they carried
alongside their thighs. He knew from this that
they would commence firing in short order. There
was no time for any explanations, and even throwing
up their arms in token of surrender might not
count for anything.</p>
<p>What could be done? Allan was at his wits&rsquo; ends
to know. His heart seemed to be in his throat as
he surveyed the galloping soldiers, and then, twisting
his head around, contemplated the shore haven,
still some little distance away.</p>
<p>Suddenly the water splashed up in a little jet not
five feet on one side of the clumsy boat. Bumpus
gave a squeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! they&rsquo;re shooting at us, as sure as anything!&rdquo;
he exclaimed in dismay.</p>
<p>Allan knew this even before the other called out,
for had he not seen the little puff of smoke break
out of the oncoming squad of Uhlans? Others
would also be following suit just as soon as they
found a chance, he knew very well.</p>
<p>Only one thing favored them, and this was the
fact that it is a most difficult feat for any one
mounted on a madly running horse to do accurate
shooting, no matter how much he may have practiced.
Still, if a number of the men started to give
them a volley there must always be a chance of a
bullet striking home. Besides, at the present rate
of advance the cavalrymen would be on the very
brink of the river by the time the boys reached the
other shore, and then what could save them?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Allan wondered whether it would be of any use
for them to jump overboard and dive. They might
manage to make the bank, but only to be picked off
by the Uhlan marksmen a minute later.</p>
<p>It was while he was worrying in this fashion that
there came a quick explosion close by that gave them
all a rude shock, followed by minor crashes, plainly
the discharge of shells. The desperate driver had
fired his fuse and blown up the caisson with its
contents.</p>
<p>Although there was considerable splashing in the
water around them, as certain portions of the
wrecked wagon fell in the river, in some way or
other the inmates of the boat escaped injury. Allan
believed they were partly protected by the jutting
foundation of the destroyed bridge, which fortunately
came between the exploding ammunition
wagon and the boat.</p>
<p>Still Giraffe and Thad strove to reach the further
bank, though just what they could do to save themselves
after that had been accomplished was a conundrum
for every one. Bumpus was turning his
head to look behind now, consumed by a terrible
curiosity that seemed to gnaw into his very vitals.
He stared at the oncoming riders and wondered
whether the next volley they might fire would bring
disaster to himself and comrades. He could see
that they were dead in earnest, and that while this
fighting spirit moved them they were not inclined
to show mercy to those they believed to be
their enemies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Bumpus could not tear his eyes away from the
terrible spectacle. Those galloping soldiers began
to assume gigantic appearance to his wondering and
horrified eyes. And then, even as he looked again,
he heard a loud roaring sound as if other caissons
had taken up the challenge and were also exploding
in one, two, three order.</p>
<p>To his amazement he suddenly realized that the
leading Uhlans had vanished in a cloud of smoke&mdash;men
and horses seemed to have been enveloped in
destruction, and those behind, panic-stricken, were
driving their animals this way and that, wild to get
off the road. But Allan knew what it meant, and
that the French battery had taken up a position
where the gunners could command the bridgehead!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">WITH THE FRENCH AT THE FRONT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over but the shouting, fellows!&rdquo; cried
Giraffe, holding the boat steady in the current by
means of his push-pole, while with his companions
he watched to see what was transpiring over on the
further shore.</p>
<p>The shells from the French battery continued to
burst amidst the rapidly scattering Uhlans, showing
the wonderful accuracy of the gunners&rsquo; aim. Knowing
that it would be simple madness to attempt a
further advance in the face of such a raking fire, the
Germans had done the only possible thing under the
circumstances. This was to scatter like a flock of
sheep into the midst of which a wolf has suddenly
leaped.</p>
<p>The four scouts no longer found any reason to
fear those riders; in fact, the shoe was on the other
foot now, and the Uhlans were fleeing from the peril
that lay in French shells.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Giraffe clapped his hands excitedly and indulged
in some of his characteristic sayings as he applauded
the fine work of their friends a quarter of a mile
away, it might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! look!&rdquo; cried Bumpus, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s some one
swimming across the river below us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our friend, the driver of the caisson!&rdquo;
snapped Giraffe immediately. &ldquo;Glad he escaped being
hit with any of his own shells when he let her
go bang. Say, this is something like it now. It
makes a heap of difference whose ox is gored,
they tell us. And mebbe those Uhlan lancers don&rsquo;t
feel so stuck up, with all that chasing across fields
to get away from the shells. Oh! did you see that
one burst right alongside a rider&mdash;and he&rsquo;s down,
sure he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it frightful, though?&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpus,
whose face had as usual lost all its customary color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get ashore,&rdquo; suggested Thad, for there
might always be a chance that one of the fugitive
riders would appear on the bank, determined to get
even with the boys in the boat, under the impression
that they had served as stalking horses to lure himself
and his mates into a trap.</p>
<p>Giraffe started to make use of his pole again, and
as Thad also manipulated the oar they quickly made
land. Allan was the first to jump ashore. He immediately
began to draw the bow of the flat-bottom
boat up on the little shelving beach they fortunately
found waiting for them. Then the others tumbled
out, Bumpus and his bag being the last to debark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>About this time the firing ceased as abruptly as
it had commenced. Evidently the one in charge of
the field battery considered that it was useless to
expend any more valuable ammunition on such a
scattered detachment on the enemy, especially since
the demoralized remnant of the large Uhlan force
was fleeing madly and no longer to be feared.</p>
<p>The driver of the destroyed caisson had by this
time managed to crawl out of the water. He shook
himself much after the manner of a big dog after a
swim, and then came toward the boys, who happened
to be near the road leading away from the
former bridge.</p>
<p>They met him in a spirit of genuine boyish enthusiasm,
each fellow insisting on shaking hands with
the Frenchman, which act caused him to smile with
pleasure. Then the little party started along the
road, hoping to come in contact with the battery
before fresh orders caused it to change positions
again.</p>
<p>In this they were successful, and before long they
found themselves surrounded by men in the French
blue, who acted in a most friendly fashion. The one
in command exchanged a few sentences with the
driver. Thad, listening, had reason to believe that
he was commending the discretion of the man in destroying
his charge rather than take chances of having
it fall into the hands of the enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Then came their turn. In a few short sentences
Thad managed to explain who they were and how
they happened to be there. It was fortunate that
the French captain of the guns could speak English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would be under great obligations to you,
M&rsquo;sieu the Captain, if we were allowed to ride on
one of the caissons further, in case you may be
going on,&rdquo; Thad wound up with.</p>
<p>He must have made a very pronounced impression
on the soldier, for it was really an unusual request,
and one that under normal conditions could
not very well be granted. But after a brief period
of consideration the officer nodded his head in the
affirmative, much to the secret delight of Bumpus
in particular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are about to start for a new position,&rdquo; was
what the captain said, briefly; &ldquo;and no doubt room
may be found for you on a couple of the caissons.
You must be good friends to France to be made a
target for Uhlan guns. Yes, after all, it is but a
little thing, and no harm can come of it. So find
your seats, young Messieurs, for we are off immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gunners and the drivers of ammunition carts
were eager to accommodate. Somehow it seemed
as though they looked on Thad and his three chums
as allies. Possibly this came of their having shared
dangers of the driver who blew up his store of
ammunition lest it fall into the hands of the invading
foe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Thad and Bumpus were given seats on one caisson
while the other boys found room on a second.
The driver who had no longer a charge also secured
a lift, for it turned out there was another seat
vacant on a gun; and the fact that one of the other
men had a bloody bandage wrapped around his left
arm told the story of the shrapnel that had burst
overhead.</p>
<p>So they were soon on the road, the horses again
galloping under the incentive of both voices and
lashes. Thad took note of the fact that their progress
was in a southerly direction. From this he
knew that by degrees the battery would manage to
swing around until it reached a location much nearer
the spot where that furious boom of great guns told
of a battle in progress.</p>
<p>The boys all knew that they were yielding to the
great temptation that had waylaid them. By rights
they should be heading directly for Paris instead of
allowing themselves to be tempted to follow along
the course of the French army. Bumpus, if given
the opportunity, might have taken that course, but
it was a case of three against one, and he had no
choice in the matter but to keep right along with the
balance of the company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>In fact, to tell the truth, much as Thad and Allan
and Giraffe would like to please such a beloved chum
as Bumpus, they just could not resist the yearning
to try and see more of the tremendous historical
events that were transpiring on those battlefields of
France, so near the capital that the boom of the big
guns might almost be faintly heard there, if the wind
proved favorable.</p>
<p>Discretion was thrown to the winds. Such a
grand chance to witness the making of history came
but once in a life-time, and they would be silly to
deliberately cast it aside when it was offered to
them for the taking.</p>
<p>All they had to do was to sit there and allow themselves
to be carried along to the new location of
the fast-moving field battery, evidently now scheduled
to take a more active part in the day&rsquo;s engagement.</p>
<p>Thad knew that he was doing a very rash thing.
His conscience also reproached him whenever he
thought of poor Bumpus, for it was really a pity
that the stout chum, who did not have much stomach
for fighting and exciting adventures, should be
dragged into their midst. Thad tried to salve his
conscience by telling himself that they might run
across a chance whereby they could make themselves
useful in some capacity, perhaps by assisting the ambulance
corps connected with the Red Cross. Sooner
or later he knew there would be many Americans
enlisted in this humane work, and it would at least
give them a valid excuse for being there on the field
of battle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Now they came on other detachments of the
French army, men working big guns that seemed
to fairly shatter the surrounding atmosphere each
time they were fired. The enormous missiles that
they sent for a distance of miles must have torn
terrible holes in whatever they struck.</p>
<p>The enemy could not be seen at all, which the boys
considered most remarkable. But Thad knew how
the commanders made use of artificial eyes in the
shape of powerful field-glasses; and besides, there
were several aeroplanes darting back and forth
above in the blue heavens, the operators of which
doubtless continued to send valuable information
down by means of a prearranged system of signals.</p>
<p>Still they kept moving on along the encircling
road. Evidently they had not yet come to their
appointed station, where an attack was expected, and
scores of field guns would be needed to mow down
the grayish-green clad lines of the Germans before
they came within reach of the rapid-fire pieces.</p>
<p>All the time the boys noticed that they were passing
through heavy masses of troops eager for action.
Temporary trenches had been thrown up, a mere
shadow of an excuse when compared with the wonderful
concrete creations that later on became such
a part of warfare along the Aisne. Behind these
ridges of earth the soldiers in blue lay, watching
and waiting for the coming of their enemies, and
ready to do their duty with gun and bayonet after
the customary gallant French style.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Many curious glances were cast in the direction
of the four boys in khaki who sat with the drivers
of the caissons. Perhaps they were taken for English
lads, as had happened more than once before,
and in some fashion connected with the new alliance
that was being formed between France and her
neighbor across the Channel.</p>
<p>Then the battery came to a pause. Thad guessed
what it meant, so that he hardly had need to discover
the captain making motions to him. They must
jump down now and take care of themselves.</p>
<p>According, Thad left his seat, in which action he
was speedily followed by the other three boys.
Bumpus even grinned a little, as though pleased. It
had been a regular nightmare for a time for the fat
boy, clinging desperately to some frail support
alongside, as the ammunition wagon bowled recklessly
along the rutty road, and jolting the breath
from his body with fits and starts.</p>
<p>So they saw their good friends leave them, still
heading for their appointed position in the long line
that waited for the coming of the gray hosts of the
Kaiser. The boys discovered the driver waving his
hand back to them, and as one they sent an answering
signal. They never set eyes on him, or any of
his comrades again; and if they actually survived the
horrors of the amazing Battle of the Marne the fact
remained a mystery to Thad and his comrades. Still,
in times to come, they would often delight to recall
their adventure of the road and the river, and wonder
what became of the French caisson driver who
blew up his ammunition wagon rather than yield his
charge to the foe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>What they should do now was a question. No
doubt their presence on the firing line would not long
be tolerated. Thad expected some officer to come
along at almost any minute and demand to know
who they were and by what right they were at the
front, when all boys of their age should be far in
the rear. He was also prepared to do anything that
military authority might decree, though cherishing
a vague hope that by some means they might be able
to secure glimpses of the battle destined to decide
the fate of Paris.</p>
<p>Men were around them chattering in French and
looking curiously at the cluster of lads in khaki.
Had it been a German camp they would very likely
have been under a volley of gruff questions as to
the reason of their presence; but the French are by
nature exceedingly polite, and so far no one had
ventured to question their right to be there.</p>
<p>All about them could be heard the thunderous
discharge of the big guns that were shelling depots
of the enemy and trying to delay the inevitable advance
of the German army corps threatening the
capital from the northwest. The air at all times
throbbed with these mighty shocks. Shells, too,
from enemy guns could be heard exploding here and
there, showing that it was a game of &ldquo;give and take&rdquo;
on both sides.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>About this time Thad noticed that they were beginning
to be the centre of a considerable crowd.
Men passing by stopped to observe the four lads and
comment in their voluble way. Still, there were no
unfriendly glances cast upon them, which was one
comfort. In good time, no doubt, an officer would
bustle up and proceed to ply them with questions.
Thad hoped he could satisfy the demands that would
be made upon them. Bumpus, on his part, was
secretly wishing that the French commander might
be so taken with their looks that he would be pleased
to invite them to join him in a jolly little dinner
shortly, for Bumpus had lately become aware of the
fact that he was decidedly hungry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he comes now, Thad,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe,
noticing a sudden movement further along, where
the soldiers hastened to fall back and make way
for a number of advancing men in uniform.</p>
<p>Yes, Thad could himself see that one of these bore
the insignia of rank that stamped him at least a
colonel. He had made up his mind just what to say
in order not to bore the officer, and at the same time
create a favorable impression on his mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Another look caused Thad to begin to feel some
uneasiness. He fancied that the old officer with the
white imperial, who had such a decidedly military
air about him, also looked very severe. And that
other party at his side, who was doing considerable
talking it seemed, why did he take it upon himself to
point his finger toward the four boys in that aggressive
manner?</p>
<p>Straight up to where the scouts stood came the
little party. Thad raised his hand in respectful
salute, in which act he was copied by his mates. To
the astonishment of them all, at a word of command
from the officer, two soldiers stepped forward and
laid rough hands on poor, astounded Giraffe, who
stood there with his mouth open, simply staring at
the stern colonel.</p>
<p>Thad, listening, heard a word that gave him a
nasty shock. It was spoken by the man in the company
of the officer, and had been hissed with much
vehemence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">GIRAFFE FACES A SERIOUS CHARGE</span></h2>
<p>Consternation seized upon the boys when Giraffe
was thus summarily arrested, and, in so many
words, charged with aiding the enemy in the guise
of a spy. Such a serious accusation is enough to
frighten even the most valiant heart; for in many
cases it means a short shrift and a file of soldiers,
with a kneeling figure against a dead wall.</p>
<p>Thad managed to recover the use of his tongue.
He faced the grim soldier who wore the marks of
a colonel, which he probably had won over in Algiers
or Morocco battling with dark-faced Moors
or the tribes of the desert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, M&rsquo;sieu,&rdquo; Thad had started to say, &ldquo;there
must be some terrible mistake about this. We are
all American boys, as we can prove without any
trouble. Please give us a chance to explain how
we happen to come here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>The colonel frowned at first. Evidently he had
it on the tip of his tongue to say gruffly that there
was no time to bother with explanations, when at
any moment his regiment might be engaged in a life
and death struggle with the invading foe, and that
all of them must be put in confinement until later on,
when they could be placed on trial.</p>
<p>Just then it happened that the old soldier came
under the magical influence of Thad&rsquo;s winning
smile. He set his teeth harder together, as though
resisting the evident blandishment of that frank,
eager, boyish look; but it was no use. Perhaps
memories rushed into his mind of some favorite son
or grandson at home. He shrugged his square
shoulders, nodded his head, and went on to say, in
excellent English:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you a very brief opportunity to explain,
as you call it, young m&rsquo;sieu. Lead them all
to my temporary quarters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several minutes later the four boys found themselves
confronting the colonel and several of his officers.
A number of armed privates stood alongside,
where they could seize the boys should occasion
arise. The commanding officer looked at Thad, and
he was still frowning as though not sure that he
should go to all this bother for just a quartette of
fairly grown lads in khaki, who could just as well
be sent to the rear under guard, to await his pleasure
when he had less weighty affairs on his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell me of what my comrade is accused,
M. le Colonel?&rdquo; asked Thad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is all very simple,&rdquo; replied the soldier, shortly.
&ldquo;This gentleman, whom you see with me, happens
to be a confidential agent of my government. He
has declared to me most positively that he certainly
saw yonder boy in close conversation with a notorious
spy of the German Government, and who has
since been apprehended. This, he says, was just two
days before war was declared by Germany on France
and while Paris was feverish with excitement, for
it was on the streets of the capital he tells me this
meeting took place. That justifies me in making an
arrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad looked relieved. Grave as the accusation
might be reckoned, he felt sure of being able to clear
Giraffe, if only the colonel showed any inclination
to be reasonable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not in the least doubt the intentions of the
gentleman,&rdquo; Thad went on to say; &ldquo;and, of course,
he believes all he states to you; but at the same time
he has mistaken some other party for my chum here.
In the first place, we were away up on the Rhine
when war was declared. We had left the mother
of this other chum at a famous sanitarium in Antwerp
to be treated, and we were making a trip down
the Rhine in a small cruising boat when we heard
the thrilling news.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Then Thad went on in a graphic fashion to narrate
how they determined to hasten to the Belgian
seaport as fast as they could go; with what perplexing
difficulties their passage through that section
of Belgium had been attended, and how in the end
they had been compelled to turn back so as to go
through the friendly Netherlands to Rotterdam in
order to get a boat that would take them to the city
on the schedule.</p>
<p>Step by step he explained how they found that
Mrs. Hawtree had hurriedly left the city of Antwerp
in the company of the doctors and nurses connected
with the sanitarium and started overland to Paris,
where a branch hospital existed; and also how they
had followed.</p>
<p>Somehow Thad seemed to tell all this in such an
interesting way that he had the colonel spell-bound.
Minutes were passing; the boom of bursting shells
could be heard all around them; the Germans were
undoubtedly coming closer and closer all the time,
yet he stood there and let the boy proceed to the
very end, where he told of the chase along the road,
the destruction of the bridge, the coming of the
Uhlans, the blowing up of the ammunition wagon by
the driver, and last, but not least, how the field
battery shelled the cavalrymen and saved the boys
from a premature end.</p>
<p>It certainly made a thrilling story, and small blame
to the colonel for allowing himself to stand there
and drink it in. A Frenchman loves to hear of daring,
because he himself is by nature adventurous.
When Thad, in addition, showed him various letters
they had received, which all went to prove his
declaration to the effect that Giraffe would sooner
cut off his right hand than do anything to betray
the interests of France, evidently the colonel had
made his mind up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Turning to the secret agent, he conversed with
him in low tones for a brief time. Then he once
more faced Thad and held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gentleman is himself now convinced that he
must have made a mistake, though he still says it
was a boy resembling your friend in a remarkable
degree whom he saw talking with the seized German
spy. Let us then forget it. What can I do to show
you how French soldiers appreciate their American
cousins across the sea and also to make amends to
you in a measure for having put you to this trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus thereupon gave Thad an eager thump
with his elbow, and managed to say, half aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget it&rsquo;s nearly dinner-time, Thad, and
we haven&rsquo;t had hardly a bite since last night in the
bargain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;sieu le Colonel,&rdquo; said Thad, paying no attention
to this imperative demand from the rear, &ldquo;all
we can hope for is that if we are sent back
at least allow us to see something of the battle from
some friendly hilltop. And, believe me, that all the
while we watch from a distance we shall be
hoping that victory comes to those who are defending
their capital against the invaders. Our sympathies
are with the lilies of France!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>That quite completed the conquest of the doughty
colonel. He gave Thad&rsquo;s hand an extra squeeze and
hastened to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall simply insist that you retire from the
firing-line. After that I wash my hands of you,
young messieurs from our sister republic. You shall
see how my brave <i>enfants</i> meet the rush of the army
that has broken its sacred treaties and swept across
a neutral country thinking to catch us asleep. Ah!
and you will never forget what glorious deeds the
defenders of Paris expect to accomplish this day,
and the next, and the next, until the invader has
been chased back to his strongholds beyond the
Rhine. I am from Alsace, and our hour has struck
for revenge. Yes, and I shall give orders also that
you dine with my men in the field. That is all.
Adieu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, all of them were greatly pleased with
the outcome of the affair. It had looked rather
gloomy for Giraffe at one time, but, thanks to the
clever way in which Thad had managed, as well as
his insinuating manner of speech, they had come out
of the trouble with honor. And to Bumpus, one of
the most pleasing features of the situation was that
they stood a good show now to break their fast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Shortly afterward the boys were allowed to sit
down with several minor officers, who prepared to
make a &ldquo;short dinner&rdquo; under fire. Soldiers can show
a contempt for danger on occasion; and the fact that
an occasional shell threw up the earth now and then
within a hundred yards of where they sat did not
seem to interfere at all with the appetites of the
diners.</p>
<p>The boys had all they wanted of such food as the
rations consisted. Two of the Frenchmen could
speak English, and so many questions were asked
and answered during the progress of the meal, Thad
taking pleasure in telling more concerning the adventures
that had fallen to the lot of himself and
three comrades since they first learned that war had
been declared.</p>
<p>Afterward they were informed that they must
start at once toward the rear, as at any time that
section of the front might witness a terribly fierce
charge on the part of the oncoming German hosts,
so that unarmed boys really had no business to be
loitering there.</p>
<p>Recognizing that this was sound logic, Thad led
his companions along another road, that he had
learned had its other terminus in Paris itself. They
might expect to meet many detachments of French
recruits hastening toward the front, fresh batteries
on their way, together with innumerable motor lorries,
tractors drawing loads, ambulances, and other
petrol-driven army vehicles laden with stores or ammunition,
all heading toward the line where those
men in the French blue waited calmly for a new
phase of the fight to open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>All of the boys were feeling fairly fresh now, and
evidently that meal had put new spirit in Bumpus
for one, since he did not utter the slightest complaint
as he trudged valiantly along in the wake of his
more energetic chums.</p>
<p>Thad, after a while, began to keep his eyes about
him, meaning to call a halt if they should happen
to come upon a knoll where a view might be obtained
of the lower country where those new trenches had
been thrown up so hurriedly. What he wanted to
be able to say was that he and the rest had actually
seen with their own eyes some of the movements of
the two rival armies at this battle for the possession
of Paris.</p>
<p>The early September sun was more than half way
down toward the horizon when the scout leader believed
he had found the place he was looking for.
True, the elevation did not amount to a great deal,
for which, incidentally, Bumpus was grateful, because
he did hate the worst kind to climb hills; but
it seemed to offer them what Thad called a &ldquo;coign
of vantage.&rdquo; Possibly his chums had only a dim idea
as to just what that wonderful expression meant;
but nevertheless, they asked no questions; accepting
things as they found them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Really, it was quite a fine view that opened around
them. The line of vision was not obstructed to any
extent, particularly toward the north. Here and
there, to be sure, lay fields of drifting smoke, showing
where a battery was at work. Smaller patches
of the same might indicate the explosion of great
shells; while higher in the air shrapnel patches could
be seen, looking strangely white in comparison with
the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the place for us to spend the rest of the
afternoon,&rdquo; Bumpus hastened to remark, fearful lest
his silence might be misconstrued, and that the others
would figure on looking further.</p>
<p>No one contradicted him, and so it seemed settled
that they would remain there until toward nightfall,
at any rate.</p>
<p>The road was far from deserted, because any number
of vehicles kept coming forward and ascending
the rise with accelerated speed. Often at the crown
the deeply interested drivers would pause, not to rest
their motors, but to stare across that stretch of country
to where the roar of guns was ever increasing.</p>
<p>Then, as though some high sense of duty urged
them on, they would suddenly start down the descent
and speed away for the front. Perhaps for
aught they knew much of the success or failure of
the French in holding the oncoming Teuton hosts
in check might depend on the prompt delivery of the
cargo of ammunition which their particular van
was fetching up for the big guns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Just then Thad would have given a great deal for
a good field-glass, but since they lacked such an aid
to vision, owing to a robbery some time back, they
must get on the best they could without. Giraffe
would suffer less than any of the best because of his
extraordinary sight; and he promptly promised to
pass along any startling discoveries his advantage in
that line might give him.</p>
<p>It may have been half an hour after the four
chums located on the crown of that low hill when
a sudden increase in the near-by thunder told them
a new phase of the operations must have broken out.</p>
<p>Giraffe had been down at a spring they had noticed
at the foot of the hill in order to quench his
thirst, for the day was pretty warm; and so many
vehicles passing along the road caused considerable
dust to float in the air, all of which seemed to irritate
that long throat of the tall scout.</p>
<p>He came leaping up to the lookout, his face filled
with eagerness. The others were already straining
their eyes to discover what this uproar meant; but
after all it was the sharp vision of Giraffe that first
made an important discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure as you live, the battle is on, fellows!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, excitedly. &ldquo;Look over there near that
ridge and you&rsquo;ll see what resembles a running torrent
pouring over the crowd. Well, instead of
water, that&rsquo;s made up of a never-ending stream of
men, all in the Kaiser&rsquo;s gray uniforms. Whee!
they&rsquo;re beginning to show in three other places, too.
The woods are full of &rsquo;em, seems like, tens and tens
of thousands, and every man of &rsquo;em pushing right
on through shot and shell!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Almost stunned by the thrilling spectacle, the four
lads stood there and watched while, doubtless, their
hearts pounded like mad against their ribs. Indeed,
it would have to be a strange sort of a boy who could
witness such a wonderful sight without unusual emotion.</p>
<p>Presently Giraffe again broke out. It was as if
he could not restrain himself, and this way of telling
his mates what he saw served as an escape valve
for his surcharged feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you can see that the French have got busy
and are sending every kind of missile right into the
midst of the masses of Germans. Every time a shell
breaks it leaves a horrible gap, but only for a second,
because the living close it up like magic. Oh!
what madness for them to charge in such mass formations
in these days of machine guns and shrapnel
and big shells. But that&rsquo;s the way they&rsquo;ve been
taught, to go forward shoulder to shoulder; and
Germans couldn&rsquo;t fight like our men do, each on his
own initiative. Oh! just see them coming on still,
will you? I believe there must be a million of &rsquo;em
pouring over that ridge. But the French don&rsquo;t seem
to be giving way a yard, do they?&rdquo; And then, overcome
by his emotions, Giraffe fell silent, though
never for a second did he take his eyes off the thrilling
drama that was being enacted not more than
two miles away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">THE BATTLE</span></h2>
<p>When the vast German army smashed a way
through Belgium and commenced that historic rush
toward apparently doomed Paris, few there were
who were bold enough to believe the French capital
could be saved. History would repeat itself, Paris
fall to the invading hosts, and, having subdued poor
France, the Kaiser&rsquo;s victorious legions could next
turn on Russia and repeat the lesson in preparedness.</p>
<p>Once across the French border, and following out
long-since-made plans of campaign, the Germans
separated into four tremendous streams of men and
guns, all sweeping along prearranged lines and heading
for Paris.</p>
<p>One of these was held up before Verdun, which
fortress was fated to stand in the way of German
success to the end of time, even as Gibraltar towers
at the entrance of the Mediterranean. Three other
living streams forged ahead, pushing aside all opposition
on the part of the French forces, as well as
the comparatively small British army that fought
them gallantly, though unsuccessfully, at Mons and
other places.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>As these immense masses of armed troops approached
the region of the French capital, the desperation
of the defenders increased. But, fortunately
for them, there was a man who kept his head
through the near-panic and never lost faith. This
man was Joffre, the same commander-in-chief who,
in after days, continuously baffled the efforts of the
most astute German generals to again take the initiative
in their hands, after they lost it at the great
five-day battle of the Marne.</p>
<p>It was to fall to the lot of General Von Kluck,
more than any of his fellows, to break through the
line of French defense and start the siege of Paris.
Those wonderful mortars that had smashed the
steel-domed forts of Liege and Namur in Belgium
would most likely have made short work of the outlying
defences of the French capital, once they came
within long range.</p>
<p>But something happened.</p>
<p>It may never be fully known to the outside world
just how the wonderfully well-arranged plans of the
Germans met with a hitch, or why the army of Von
Kluck, after getting so close to Paris, suddenly
veered aside toward the west and commenced to pass
by on another tack. Depend upon it, he had good
reasons for so doing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>This, then, was the situation on that September
afternoon when Thad and his three chums stood on
the low hill and watched the invading army coiling
over the ridge like a never-ending nest of writhing
serpents. The Germans had no other choice save to
attack. Unless they could break through the cordon
that Joffre had managed to stretch before the city
they must continue their great cart-wheel sweep
around toward the Marne, and with the French
pushing them on, keep going back toward the border
again, perhaps in what would be next door to
a rout.</p>
<p>On the other hand, could they only thrust the
French aside here, a gap would open in the defences
through which access could be obtained to the inner
lines; and a glorious victory loom up before them.</p>
<p>Gradually the battle spread before the eyes of the
little audience of scouts on that isolated pinnacle
two miles away. They could see charging masses
flung back by the fierceness of the fire from hundreds
of machine guns, together with others of
larger bore. The ground must be covered with dead
and wounded, still the human tide continued to pour
over the low ridge like the water passing down the
sluice leading to the wheel of a grist mill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;I never dreamed men could be so reckless of life
and death,&rdquo; Allan shouted in Thad&rsquo;s ear, for ordinary
talking was of course next to impossible in all
that horrid din. &ldquo;They seem bent on breaking
through at all costs. I think it must be they mean
to tire the French out in this one spot by continuous
fighting. Then again perhaps the ammunition
may run low, and that will give them the chance
they want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s just awful, awful!&rdquo; declared Bumpus,
putting a hand before his eyes as if to shut out the
sight; though a short time later found him staring
as hard as ever, such was the dreadful fascination
of the ever-changing war picture.</p>
<p>The German guns were trying to blast a way
through at the same time. Here, there and everywhere
the boys could see shells bursting. Often
these threw up geysers of earth and stones as they
exploded after burying themselves in the ground;
and no doubt vast craters began to appear all along
the French front, to remind those who saw them
at a later date how terribly the modern machinery of
war worked.</p>
<p>As time passed it became plainly evident that the
French line was holding sturdily. Somehow this
apparent fact seemed to give Thad and his chums
a feeling as of relief. While they were none of
them as yet wholly committed to the cause of the
enemies of the Teuton race, at the same time they
felt a deep sympathy for the French. Besides, most
American boys always feel for the under dog in a
fight, and that was what France seemed when pitted
against the enormous resources of men and munitions
and guns controlled by the Germans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s going to be a sort of draw for today,
after all,&rdquo; suggested Giraffe, as the sun sank
lower, and the battle still continued, with neither
side seeming to make any perceptible advance worth
mentioning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But since it was the Kaiser who attacked,&rdquo; Allan
went on to say positively, &ldquo;it must be set down
as a defeat for the Germans that they failed to
carry their point. And depend on it, the French
will be nerved for greater things tomorrow. They
have proved that they can hold the enemy up; and
that will give them courage to attack in turn. Am
I right, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of the boys were tired under the strain, but
already they could detect signs telling them that the
fighting would soon be discontinued, for that day
at least. The Germans had been beaten back again
and again, no matter how they varied the form of
attack. If they gained small advantages in some
sectors it was to lose in others. During the night
doubtless hurried councils of war would be held, and
by the time another dawn broke the battle, if continued
at all, would develop upon some new basis.</p>
<p>Gradually the firing dwindled down until as the
sun sank out of sight, save for the regular booming
of certain guns that had been given a special mission
to carry out, the myriad batteries had ceased
operations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Night would soon be falling on that dreadful
field. The boys could easily picture some of the
scenes that must be taking place there, as Red Cross
attendants with stretchers stumbled among the piles
of dead and wounded, seeking those most in need
of succor, while all around them arose groans and
calls for water.</p>
<p>However, about this time their own condition demanded
attention. They had been given a small
extra portion of food while with the French, enough
to stave off hunger to some degree. Thad proposed
that they leave their elevated post and seek a spot
further down in the valley, where they might stay
until day came again.</p>
<p>The necessity of passing a night in the open had
little terror for any of those scouts. Many times in
the past had they camped out when the conditions
were not half as favorable as now. Fortunately the
weather was quite warm, and consequently they
would not miss the blankets to which they were
accustomed when in camp.</p>
<p>Once down on the level, they entered a patch of
woods and looked for a place to throw themselves
on the ground before the night closed in fully. The
moon was just past the full stage, and would rise
after a short interval, though clouds had gathered
overhead, and a condition of semi-darkness might be
looked for.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Finding what promised to afford them a fairly
comfortable camping place for the night, they commenced
to eat the food that their friends in the
French camp had so kindly provided. Sitting there
they could occasionally hear some belated motor
working its passage up the hill not far distant. Then
every little while would come a savage burst of
firing from some quarter. Possibly a belated movement
of troops on one side or the other suggested
a surprise attack, and this caused the outburst from
quick-firing guns.</p>
<p>Bumpus had managed to choke down the dry
food. He remembered about that spring, and was
haunted by thoughts of cold clear water trickling
down his parched throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll go along over and get a drink,&rdquo; he
remarked; &ldquo;anybody else want to keep me company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It turned out that all the rest of them had been
ahead of him, and were not in need of a fresh supply
just then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your wits about you, Bumpus,&rdquo; warned
Allan; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s getting dark, you see, and of old we
know what a great fellow you always were to lose
yourself when there was half a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>please</i> don&rsquo;t stray away, Bumpus,&rdquo; urged
Giraffe indolently, as he sprawled there at his ease
on the turf; &ldquo;it&rsquo;d be rough on the lot of us now if
after a hard day&rsquo;s tramp we had to start out and
scour the woods around here to find you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus snorted with disdain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! don&rsquo;t you worry about me, Giraffe,&rdquo; he
remarked cuttingly. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t hatched yesterday.
I&rsquo;ve picked up a <i>little</i> intelligence since we were up
in Maine, you must remember. And I&rsquo;m not going
to get lost; just put that in your pipe and smoke
it, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he stalked off, and started toward the
quarter where Thad had told him he would find the
spring. Bumpus was never more sure of anything
in his whole life than that he could never lose himself
under such simple conditions as existed; and
yet, strange as it may seem, that was just what he
did manage to do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">THE WANDERINGS OF BUMPUS</span></h2>
<p>Bumpus managed to find the spring all right, for
he kept on the alert. After satisfying his thirst,
and starting back, he must have lost his bearings in
some manner; perhaps on account of lying down on
the side of the water that appealed most to him,
and then making a mistake in commencing his return
trip.</p>
<p>He did not realize this until he had been following
what seemed to be the winding path for fully five
minutes without coming to anything that looked
familiar.</p>
<p>Then Bumpus was overwhelmed with chagrin.
He could already picture Giraffe laughing at him if
he raised his voice and called to the others to let him
know where the camp lay. So he grimly determined
to keep still, and find it for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I can do that without much trouble,&rdquo; he
told himself in a confident tone. &ldquo;I know now where
I made the mistake; and by turning to the right
sharply I&rsquo;ll come in on them from the other side.
If Giraffe asks me why I did that I&rsquo;ll give him to
understand I was only scouting around a bit to see
what the ground looked like.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>So with his mind temporarily relieved Bumpus
once more commenced to push on. He found it
harder going, now that he had abandoned what he
had believed to be the trail to and from the spring.
But Bumpus was very persevering, as most stout
fellows seem to be, once they get going. He labored
on until another ten minutes had slipped past. Still
there was no sign of the spot where he had left his
three comrades.</p>
<p>Again did he try to figure out where he had made
a blunder. Why, this thing was really getting to
be a big joke, and Bumpus feared he would have to
face the music of Giraffe&rsquo;s scorn after he did manage
to find the rest. For even then his confidence
in ultimate success had not been wholly chilled; it
was only a matter of time, and figuring things out.</p>
<p>He tried to determine if he could find the location of
the road. This he might easily have done had there
been any travel over it just then; but unfortunately
the guns were growling almost continuously, so that
try as he would he failed to discover any sound of
moving vans or advancing batteries going to the
front, it might be Red Cross hospital ambulances
rapidly speeding toward Paris with their loads of
grievously wounded partisans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>When a full half hour had slipped by, as near as
Bumpus could gauge time, he began to realize that
after all he had actually lost himself, a thing he had
so loudly boasted could never happen again.</p>
<p>Bumpus was thoroughly disgusted. He hated to
lift his voice and try to attract the attention of his
friends. It would make him feel like one of the
helpless babes in the woods to cry for help, and wait
there until one of his chums came out to pilot him
into camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he was saying to himself in a bitter vein,
&ldquo;of all the chumps you certainly take the cake,
Bumpus Hawtree. Now if this were out there
among the Rockies, or in one of the big Maine
woods, there might be a little excuse for your getting
mixed in your bearings; but to think of doing it
over here in a silly little French forest! After this
I&rsquo;d better get them to attach a horn to my neck, so
I can blow a blast whenever I step out of camp, and
let them know where I&rsquo;m at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although heartily ashamed at being compelled to
do so, he even throttled his chagrin enough to raise
his voice and try to shout. Somehow or other the
effort did not seem to be much of a success. His
voice was husky, so that he could not do himself
justice; and then again those rival guns kept up
such a constant booming sound that it muffled his
cries to a great extent.</p>
<p>At any rate, after keeping this up for a stretch,
Bumpus grew disconsolate and determined not to
bother any more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just paddle around a while longer, hoping
that something may turn up to give me a pointer,&rdquo;
he told himself, trying to appear careless as to results.
&ldquo;But if in the end I fail, why, me to curl
up and put in the rest of the night here. I guess
it won&rsquo;t rain on me; and once morning comes I&rsquo;ll
find a road that&rsquo;ll take me somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that he pushed on again, trying a new tack,
which seemed to promise better results. He could
tell where the north lay easily enough; on account
of all the firing that was going on; yes, and doubtless
Paris was in the opposite quarter, although he
failed to discover signs in the sky to indicate this
fact, such as may usually be found where there is a
big electric-lighted city. The trouble with Bumpus
was he could not tell for the life of him whether
his three chums might be found to the north, east,
or west; and that made two chances to one that he
was going wrong.</p>
<p>He figured that much more than an hour must
have elapsed since he became&mdash;he was going to say
&ldquo;bewildered,&rdquo; but on second thoughts pronounced
that disagreeable word, &ldquo;lost.&rdquo; For aught he knew
his chums might be a mile or two away from him
by that time. Bumpus was also getting pretty tired.
His feet felt like clogs, since he was never an extra
good walker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got to come to it, I guess,&rdquo; he finally
observed, as he wiped his streaming brow with his
big red bandanna. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just push on about five minutes
longer, for it strikes me the woods seem lighter
ahead there. Now it would be a fine thing if after
all I ran onto the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breaking his way through a jungle of creepers,
he presently made a discovery that started his heart
to beating faster than its wont. Sure enough he had
come upon a road. It did not seem to run from
north to south, as that one had upon which they
stood at the time they watched the fluctuations of
the terrible battle. However, a road of any kind
encouraged Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may find some sort of house on it,&rdquo; he conjectured,
sucking in fresh hope; &ldquo;where the folks
would consent to take me in, give me a royal feed,
and even supply me with a cot for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That delightful thought buoyed up his drooping
spirits wonderfully, so that he started along the road
filled with high hopes. Ten minutes afterwards he
made another pleasant discovery. There was a
building to one side of the road. True, he failed to
discover the first sign of any light about it, but
entering the lane leading amidst shrubs and trees,
he approached the structure.</p>
<p>His surprise increased as he drew closer. It was
a very large building, and made of stone at that, as
most houses in France seem to be, for wood is seldom
ever used, being too expensive and not lasting
enough.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, looks a heap like it might be some queer
old rookery, with a tower up there in the centre,&rdquo;
Bumpus observed, as he stopped to stare again, having
come close to the structure by this time. &ldquo;I
wonder if this is some sort of sanitarium like the
one up there in Antwerp where mother stayed?
Anyway, I guess it&rsquo;s deserted, all right. Mebbe the
military authorities have ordered the folks to clear
out, because it happens to interfere with gun range.
Now, I wonder had I better try to find a bed in here,
or go on further?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tired condition forced him to make a decision
in favor of a stop. And once he had really decided,
Bumpus lost no time in putting his plan into
execution.</p>
<p>There was no trouble about getting into the building,
for the door stood invitingly open as though
hospitality might be a leading feature connected
with the people who had formerly lived here.</p>
<p>Bumpus had some matches with him, and once he
found himself in a broad hall he struck one. This
showed him that beyond lay a flight of stairs leading
to the upper story. Still not a sign of anything
moving. Bumpus was more convinced than ever
that he had the whole building to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too dead tired and sleepy now to prowl
around looking for any grub,&rdquo; he observed, with a
sigh; &ldquo;and a bed is about the best thing I can think
of. When morning comes along, why, I&rsquo;ll skirmish
about, and see if I can&rsquo;t pick up a few bites; for
sure there must be a kitchen connected with such a
big old establishment; and the cook may have forgotten
to clean it out entirely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dragged his heavy feet up the stone stairs.
At the time he vaguely wondered why everything
about him was so severe and cold and plain; and
made up his mind that living in such a sanitarium
would be almost like being in prison. A tired boy,
however, could hardly be expected to bother his
head very much over such things. If only he could
find some sort of bed, he would not be so very particular,
for Bumpus believed he did not &ldquo;care
whether school kept or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once above and he found that there was a long
narrow, gloomy corridor, with numerous open doors
on either side, all exactly alike. Other matches were
used to show him what lay inside the rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; he exclaimed, after he had investigated
several of these apartments, &ldquo;I declare if they don&rsquo;t
look like regular prison cells. But each has got an
iron cot in it, and I&rsquo;m bound to keel over right soon
if I don&rsquo;t find rest somewhere. So here goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was really little choice when it came to
selecting one of the &ldquo;cells&rdquo; for sleeping purposes.
Bumpus tried the cot, and found that while it was
a bit hard he could easily accommodate himself to
that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>The last the tired boy remembered was chuckling
over the thought of Giraffe saying, &ldquo;I knew he&rsquo;d get
lost.&rdquo; Time passed away, and then suddenly Bumpus
sat up on the cot, awakened by a strange, thrilling
and most astonishing sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">A THRILLING SPECTACLE</span></h2>
<p>When Bumpus opened his eyes he saw a weird
flickering light reflected on the wall of the small
cell-like room in which he had lain down to sleep.
Of course for the moment he did not know where
he was. Then the recollection rushed over him like
a wave, and it was all plain.</p>
<p>But had he been passing through a horrible dream
to cause that creepy sensation which boys describe
as &ldquo;goose-flesh&rdquo; to grip him? No, there came that
strange sound again, causing another spasm of
shivering. It monotonously rose and fell in the
queerest way imaginable, and somehow made Bumpus
remember a ghostly chant that he had once heard
on the stage, when his folks visiting in New York
City took him to the opera, and the grave-diggers
were discovered at work throwing up the earth in
preparation for a funeral.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Bumpus slid off his cot. The awe-inspiring sounds
certainly came in at the narrow window, and although
still trembling with excitement closely bordering
on fear, he found himself creeping toward
that opening.</p>
<p>When he reached it and looked out he saw a most
amazing sight indeed, and one that riveted his attention.
It seemed that the window opened on a
garden that was enclosed on three sides by the walls
of the long building. There were trees and shrubs
in this enclosure, also winding walks that had been
laid out for a purpose.</p>
<p>Half a dozen flickering lights could be seen trailing
along, the glow rising and falling intermittently.
These he immediately discovered were some sort of
torches held in the hands of strangely garbed men,
who walked slowly, and as they proceeded chanted
that solemn requiem in deep, hoarse voices.</p>
<p>Bumpus rubbed his eyes. Was he indeed really
awake, or could this only be a part of a most realistic
dream? Still, as he continued to look he saw
the ghostly procession, for every figure was garbed
in white, passing slowly along the serpentine path
below.</p>
<p>Then the staring scout received another shock.
His eyes, following back the line, rested on a group
that seemed to be bearing a muffled form on a
stretcher. With war in the land it was only natural
for Bumpus to jump to the conclusion that this
might be a wounded soldier, though hardly had he
come to this conviction than he changed his mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>These odd-appearing figures were not at all martial
looking. Indeed, they were intoning some Latin
hymn, he concluded, and the solemn character gave
him his clue.</p>
<p>Yes, they must be monks, or members of some
religious order that had escaped the general eviction
when the French Government ousted most of their
kind from the monasteries and convents. One of
their number had died, perhaps sacrificing his life
for France; and the Brothers were now engaged in
giving him a midnight burial, after some rule of
the order.</p>
<p>Bumpus felt a whole lot better after coming to
this conclusion, though he still continued to keep his
eyes glued on what was passing below, and did not
mean to miss the least portion of the ceremony.</p>
<p>That rising and falling chant thrilled him
strangely. He would never forget it as long as he
lived. Still it was a relief to know that he was
watching real flesh and blood people, and not visitors
from the other world; for to tell the truth Bumpus
had in the beginning suspected something of that
sort. Indeed, considering the circumstances surrounding
him, who could blame the boy for giving
way to a deep-seated fear of the supernatural, half
dormant in the hearts of every human being?</p>
<p>Now they were all in view. He counted just seventeen
of the figures in white slowly moving along
at stated intervals and holding the burning torches
above their muffled heads.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>The chant continued without a break, rising and
falling again and again as they wound in and out
among the bushes and the low-lying trees. Then
Bumpus saw that they had evidently arrived at the
spot where an open grave yawned, for the solemn
procession no longer progressed, the figures gathering
in a circle instead.</p>
<p>The torches formed a weird circle, and the deep-toned
voices rose and fell with increased fervor.
Though the watcher in the little window of the cell
could not see all that was going on because of intervening
branches, he knew that the body of the dead
monk must have been lowered, for while the singing
continued he could see men busily at work with
shovels.</p>
<p>Bumpus was feeling somewhat easier in his mind.
He knew now what manner of building he had come
across. It was not a sanitarium, such as he had
imagined, but a retreat of some kind, where benevolent
Brothers had their home away from the cares
and anxieties of the wicked world.</p>
<p>When war broke upon the land possibly some
of their number had volunteered to work with the
Red Cross units who looked after the wounded.
While their vows would forbid that they take an
active part in the fighting, still they could labor to
relieve human distress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>It might be the younger and more active members
thus offered their services to the sanitary corps for
this purpose, while the older Brothers remained in
the sanctuary. And perhaps one of those who had
gone forth had been cut down by some hostile shot,
for when the air was filled with bursting shells the
field hospitals did not always escape serious damage,
though they might be located far back of the
firing-line.</p>
<p>They had brought the dead hero home to be buried
according to the quaint rules of the Order; and accident
had allowed Bumpus to be a deeply interested
spectator of the midnight funeral.</p>
<p>He considered the situation, and decided that he
surely could not have anything to fear from these
good Brothers of the cowl and robe. The night air
was chill, which was the only reason why he continued
to shiver now, and not because he entertained
anything like fear, for he indignantly spurned the
idea.</p>
<p>So he had better go back to his cot and try to finish
his sleep, for he was in great need of further
rest. A scout should not give way to such a feeling
as timidity, Bumpus stoutly told himself several
times. In the morning he could show himself to
the monks and beg a breakfast, perhaps. Even then
it can be seen that Bumpus had an eye to the future,
and remembered how he was in the habit of expecting
a hearty meal when he woke up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>The chant was dying down by degrees, and he
supposed it would soon cease altogether, as the last
shovel of earth was placed over the Brother who
had gone to his reward. So with his teeth firmly
set and his mind made up, Bumpus crept back to
his cot, upon which he spread himself.</p>
<p>Long he lay there, his thoughts taking many curious
twists and turns, due to the fact of his recent
alarm and the remarkable sight he had witnessed.
Well, for one thing, he would have a startling story
to tell Giraffe and the others when he joined them
again. Somehow this seemed to afford him a wonderful
amount of satisfaction. But the droning
chant outside finally acted upon his mind as a sedative,
and finally Bumpus lost all recollection of time,
for he slept.</p>
<p>Not once did the tired boy awaken during the
balance of that night. When he finally opened his
eyes it was because he heard some one utter a loud
cry of amazement. Bumpus, staring upward, found
himself looking into the fat face of one of the older
Brothers, evidently astounded to discover a stranger,
and a boy at that, calmly sleeping on the cot, which,
Bumpus afterward learned, actually belonged to the
one whose midnight funeral he had witnessed.</p>
<p>Bumpus smiled blandly. Somehow he seemed to
grasp the essential facts this time without any beating
around the bush. And he meant to do everything
in his power to make friends of these recluse
members of the monastery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>The man in the rough robe asked him something.
Bumpus knew that undoubtedly he must be inquiring
as to his identity and how he came there; but,
alas! the questions being in French, he could not
make a suitable reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am an American boy; can&rsquo;t you talk English?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>Of course that last word gave the Brother the cue.
He shook his head in the negative, and then made
gestures to indicate that Bumpus should remain
where he was, after which he hobbled from the cell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, he <i>looked</i> friendly,&rdquo; Bumpus was telling
himself, with considerable satisfaction; &ldquo;and a
man as big and round as he is generally does turn
out kindly in his ways. I guess I&rsquo;m in clover, and
mebbe I&rsquo;ll get that breakfast after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly afterward he heard shuffling footsteps
approaching. Then his former interlocutor appeared
once more, this time accompanied by another
Brother, a tall, thin man with a leathery face,
upon which could be seen more or less surprise, as
though the news communicated by the fat monk
might be almost unbelievable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you speak English, sir?&rdquo; Bumpus immediately
asked, as this latter Brother came up to
where he was standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came the reply; &ldquo;but who are you, and
how do you come here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Bumpus gave an audible sigh of relief. His troubles
were probably at an end. It would be all right
now, and he could explain the situation from the
start. Yes, and surely they would understand how
a growing boy had to have his breakfast regularly.
So he began by telling his name, and how it happened
that he and three chums were over in Europe
at the time the mad war so suddenly broke out.
From that point Bumpus went on to relate in a brief
way how they had struggled to reach Antwerp so
as to join his invalid mother. Then came the discovery
that Mrs. Hawtree had gone on to the French
capital when the Germans broke into Belgium.
Bumpus described how the four scouts had decided
to reach Paris, and then found themselves cast adrift
between the lines of the hostile armies.</p>
<p>All this time the tall, thin monk listened intently.
Whenever Bumpus would pause for breath he turned
to the big fat Brother and said something in French.</p>
<p>At last Bumpus reached the point where, after
becoming lost, he happened upon a building he
thought might be some abandoned sanitarium, and,
tired almost to death, had sought a place to rest. He
also told of witnessing the burial of the patriot
Brother at midnight, and his firm belief that he had
nothing to fear from these benevolent monks whose
refuge he had invaded without meaning any harm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are welcome, boy,&rdquo; said the other, when
Bumpus finished his story. &ldquo;It is not often that we
have a guest from the outside world; but in war-times
ordinary customs and habits are no longer possible.
The Brother whom you saw buried with all
the honors of our Order did give his life for his
beloved country. He was killed while carrying the
wounded to the field hospital. And we have a score
of other members who this day are serving France
as best they may, under the sacred vows. But you
must be hungry, I fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus smiled broadly. It gave him a thrill to
know that this grim monk understood the weakness
of boys so well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so very, sir,&rdquo; he hastened to say; &ldquo;though
I was just wondering whether I&rsquo;d get any breakfast
this morning. It&rsquo;s awful kind of you to mention it,
and I think I&rsquo;ll accept the invitation, if you don&rsquo;t
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with us,&rdquo; said the tall Brother; &ldquo;our fare
is simple, but there is always plenty for any wayfarer
who may happen along. And afterwards, I myself
will set you on the right road that perhaps may take
you once more to your comrades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cheerfully did Bumpus trail along after the two
monks to the &ldquo;refrectory,&rdquo; where the members of
the Order gathered to partake of their simple repast.
He mentally shook hands with himself because
of the wonderful luck that seemed to have
taken charge of his fortunes; for surely things
could hardly have come about more happily if he had
personally shaped his destiny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">BACK TO THE FIRING LINE</span></h2>
<p>Gathered in a long, low-ceilinged room Bumpus
found the other monks assembled. Upon a long deal
table, destitute of cloth and other garnishings such
as he was accustomed to seeing in his own well-ordered
home of plenty, the American lad discovered
a number of bowls of steaming gruel. There was
bread in plenty, besides, and his friend who could
speak English bade him take a vacant seat, where
he could partake of the humble fare to his heart&rsquo;s
content.</p>
<p>It was simple enough, but, to a hungry boy, quite
appetizing; and Bumpus showed no hesitation about
&ldquo;pitching in.&rdquo; Meanwhile, as the other Brothers
were fairly consumed with curiosity concerning the
appearance of a strange lad in their midst, the tall
monk commenced to repeat the story told by
Bumpus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Evidently all of the Brothers were intensely interested.
The devotion which the boy had shown
with regard to his invalid mother made them cast
many benevolent glances toward Bumpus as the story
proceeded. And a little later, when the edge had
been taken off the guest&rsquo;s appetite, he was asked further
questions.</p>
<p>To the surprise and delight of Bumpus these
touched upon the meaning of the uniform he wore;
and presently he found that considerable interest was
taken in the calling of the Boy Scouts of America.</p>
<p>It was true they had scouts in France, as in England
and Germany, but always in these European
countries the organization hinged upon military necessities.
And when these men of peace learned how
such is not the case over in America, and that scouts
there only strive to be of use to their fellows, as
well as build up their own moral characters, they
were wonderfully pleased.</p>
<p>They talked among themselves when all this was
explained through the medium of the interpreter,
and it was evident from the smiles upon their faces
that the idea appealed powerfully to their belief in
universal service to mankind. It was a startling fact
for them to learn that in this newer country across
the sea even boys were uniting to raise the standard
of living, to help those in need of assistance, and to
build up, rather than tear down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Bumpus told lots of interesting things. He did
not bother relating how he and some of his intimate
chums had passed through certain amazing adventures,
but rather confined himself to explaining how
scouts in general went about their work; how every
member of the organization had to keep his badge
turned upside down of a morning until he had done
some kind act for another; how they were taught
to succor those in peril of their lives; to forgive
enemies when the chance came; to play the part of
amateur surgeons in cases of necessity, and in innumerable
other ways prove themselves useful members
of society.</p>
<p>Evidently those retired men of the monastery
learned many things that pleased them during that
hour Bumpus sat at their board and talked from
the fulness of his heart, for the subject was very
dear to him, and it is to most genuine scouts.</p>
<p>Finally he bethought himself of the fact that unless
he got started soon he was likely to have a difficult
time finding his three comrades. They might
leave some sort of communication for him at the
place where they spent the night, should it happen
that they felt called upon to move their quarters.
Bumpus knew that Giraffe, as well as Allan, had
considerable knowledge concerning Indian methods
of sign writing, and he rather anticipated that if
any message was found it would be along those
lines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Another thing caused him to consider it wise that
he hasten his departure. Even as he sat there in
that peaceful dining room of the monastery, with
those earnest Brothers gathered about the long table,
leaning on their elbows and listening to the answers
he made to the many questions, Bumpus could hear
an increasing uproar outside.</p>
<p>The heavy reverberation of great guns shook the
massive walls of the building; those insistent sounds
of cruel warfare invaded the peaceful dwelling,
where strife was not supposed to ever come. Half
a million men in uniform were about inaugurating
another day of buffeting and killing in the struggle
for the mastery. And it behooved him to get started
on his way.</p>
<p>So he arose from the table, his appetite thoroughly
satisfied with the humble but abundant fare of the
monks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you feel that you must go, my son,&rdquo; said the
tall Brother, once again at his side, &ldquo;allow me to set
you on your way. In the name of myself and the
rest of those assembled here, I wish to thank you for
giving us such pleasing news concerning your noble
order across the sea. With such sentiments governing
your actions we can see a glorious future opening
up before you. Take, then, our blessing with
you, my son. And we hope and pray that some
time, when peace shall have fallen on our own beloved
France; when swords shall be beaten into
pruning hooks, then, too, our loyal Boy Scouts may
forget all aspirations for military glory and live
only to be a helping force in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>So Bumpus gravely went around and shook hands
with each of the monks in turn. He never felt
prouder in all his life than just then, as they beamed
on him; and more than one placed a trembling hand
on his head as though invoking a blessing for the
comforting message this boy from America had
brought them.</p>
<p>Once outside and Bumpus became deeply interested
in what was going on. He could hardly have
been otherwise, for already it was plainly evident
from the terrific pounding of cannon that the battle
had broken out more furiously than on the preceding
day.</p>
<p>As he walked along by the side of the tall monk in
his coarse gray gown Bumpus talked of the war and
its possible end in a general limitation of armies and
navies all over the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the one great result we hope and pray for,&rdquo;
said the other, soberly; &ldquo;and toward that end we are
ready to devote everything that we possess, property
and life, too, if need be. &lsquo;Whom the gods would
destroy they first make mad,&rsquo; and certainly that is
what is happening in these dark days. But we have
faith to believe great good will surely come out of
all this terrible destruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus was sorry to say good-bye to the friendly
monk when the latter had placed him on another
road, which, he said, was the thoroughfare leading
to Paris in one direction and the field of battle in
the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget all I&rsquo;ve seen and heard while
your guest, sir,&rdquo; he told the other, whom he now
knew as Brother Ambrose; &ldquo;and perhaps some time
or other I may write to you from my home over
the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We seldom receive letters from the outside
world,&rdquo; the grave man replied, &ldquo;but under the unusual
conditions I can promise to reply should you
think to send me word. I would like to learn if you
found your mother safe, and that with your brave
comrades you had again reached that wonderful
land of promise, America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they shook hands earnestly and parted. It
must have been a wonderful experience to this recluse,
who had for so many years kept away from
the bustling world to meet a lively American boy
and learn so many surprising facts concerning the
new spirit of usefulness that had taken hold of the
rising generation across the sea.</p>
<p>Bumpus strode on, with his mind filled with the
things he had just passed through. As he progressed
he could notice that the dreadful roar was
constantly increasing as new batteries took up the
refrain and belched out their noisy defiance. Von
Kluck evidently could not give up all idea of keeping
on in the direction of the coveted prize in the
shape of the French capital, now only ten miles more
or less distant. Visions of that other successful
occasion, when Paris was taken by siege, doubtless
spurred him on to further strenuous efforts; and if
the French eventually prevented a breach in their
lines, wonderful generalship would be necessary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>The road was far from deserted now. With the
break of day fresh streams of vehicles of every description
had commenced moving, generally toward
the front, as new supplies of ammunition and food
were being constantly required to keep the army
up to top-notch fighting pitch.</p>
<p>And those motor trucks and other moving vans
that came <i>from</i> the front were never empty, Bumpus
saw. Every one carried wounded Frenchmen, brave
fellows, who doubtless had already received first
aid at the field hospitals, and were now being taken
to other institutions around Paris, where they could
in time possibly recover from their grievous injuries
and once more join their regiments.</p>
<p>Bumpus heard few groans as these vehicles, with
their ghastly freight, passed him on the road. How
his heart beat in sympathy with the gallant occupants.
Many times did he snatch his old campaign
hat off to wave it around his head in vigorous salute
as he let out a lusty cheer. This was in answer to
some waving hand that even pain and weakness
could not wholly subdue.</p>
<p>Naturally, these things affected a fellow built
along the lines of sensitive Bumpus. He wished he
had a chance to be of some use while there so close
to the battle front; and as he trudged along a resolution
began to form in his mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>At first the boy had stopped several times on the
road and looked long and wistfully back of him.
To tell the truth, he was sorely tempted to turn
&ldquo;right about face&rdquo; and go the other way. Paris
lay in that quarter, and there he was likely to find
his invalid mother. Bumpus hardly knew what his
proper course should be. He did not believe she
really needed him, because at last accounts she had
been feeling very much better. Of course, like all
mothers, she would be greatly worried concerning his
safety. On that account he wished he might communicate
with her; but since his three chums had
decided to remain there and see the end of the great
battle he really had no other choice.</p>
<p>So in spite of these pullings at his heart-strings
the boy each time kept on as he had started. His
resolution to be of some use to those in need grew
stronger all the while. The procession of ambulances
and vans filled with stricken humanity kept
that determination fresh in his mind. While Bumpus
of course did not pretend to know a quarter of
the things connected with surgery that Thad, for
instance, was able to practice, at the same time he
had been drilled in the rudiments of the art, and
could act as an assistant when called upon, bind up
ordinary cuts, stop the flow of blood, fetch cool
water to parched throats, and in many similar ways
prove of service about a field hospital.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Well, he was getting along toward the spot where
that low hill stood from which he and his three
chums had lately watched the progress of the terrible
fight on that never-to-be-forgotten afternoon
in early September. Bumpus recognized it in the
near distance by certain formations of trees at its
base, which he, as a true scout, had impressed upon
his memory at the time he stood there.</p>
<p>Then a new inspiration came to him. Why not
stop one of these drivers and find out if the man
knew anything about Thad and the rest&mdash;always
providing he, Bumpus, could manage to make him
understand English.</p>
<p>The idea impressed itself upon his mind as worth
trying. Supposing the other fellows had been upon
the road, their presence would be noticed by an observing
driver, who could easily tell the boys in
khaki were not natives.</p>
<p>With this scheme in view Bumpus waited for another
van or ambulance to approach, when he meant
to throw up his hand and signal for a stop. His
opportunity was not long in coming; indeed, somewhat
to his surprise, the motor ambulance marked
with the significant Red Cross began to pull up
even before he made motions.</p>
<p>Imagine the amazement of Bumpus when in the
khaki-clad driver at the wheel he recognized a familiar
form&mdash;no other, in fact, than his own chum,
Giraffe, grinning at him as though greatly pleased
over the unexpected meeting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">IN THE SERVICE OF THE RED CROSS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this mean, Giraffe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the natural way in which Bumpus
greeted his chum as he stared up into the smiling
face of the ambulance driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ve you been, Bumpus?&rdquo; demanded the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s too long a story for me to try to spin
right now, Giraffe, except to say I&rsquo;ve had a truly
<i>won</i>derful experience since I lost my way in the dark
last night. But please tell me what you&rsquo;re doing on
this ambulance; and I declare if you haven&rsquo;t got a
Red Cross band around your sleeve in the bargain!
Whee! this beats anything I&rsquo;ve struck yet. Tell me
about it, and are the other fellows working this same
way too, Giraffe?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nixey, Bumpus, I&rsquo;m the only driver of the lot
just now,&rdquo; the other replied; &ldquo;but all the same
they&rsquo;re doing something to help out. You see, while
we were trudging along the road a bit ago this ambulance
caught up with us. The driver had been
struck with a piece of flying shell and was bleeding
terribly, one of his arms being badly torn. He was
getting white about the gills, too, from loss of
blood, though gamely sticking to his job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my stars!&rdquo; commented the eager listener,
filled with sympathy for the valiant man who had
refused to leave his post on account of a wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he nearly fell from the seat when he
brought the ambulance to a stop in front of us.
Fact is, Thad and myself just managed to catch
him in our arms as he toppled over. Here, you can
see the mess he left. Well, Thad and Allan got
busy right away. They&rsquo;re fixing him up right now
alongside the road a little ways on there. I knew
it was up to me to get these poor chaps to the city,
so I jumped at the chance. And now I oughtn&rsquo;t to
spend another second jawing here while they need
so much attention. I&rsquo;m coming back again, and
Thad said to look for them at the field hospital.
So-long, Bumpus; keep going straight on and you&rsquo;ll
find the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the energetic Giraffe once more started
the ambulance ahead at a rapid pace. Fortunately
he knew more or less about motors and doubtless
would be able to handle the machine as well as the
next one. And once in Paris he could easily find
his way to a hospital by following some other vehicle
that also carried wounded French heroes from the
field of battle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Bumpus, left there on the road, looked after him
for a full minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; he was muttering to himself in evident
bitter disappointment, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t I think quick
enough to ask Giraffe to try and look my mother
up while in the city so as to tell her I was safe?
Just like my slow-moving wits, after all. But then
that would be selfish in me, I guess, because think
of the poor chaps who&rsquo;d have to wait so much longer
before they could receive proper medical attention.
It&rsquo;s just as well I didn&rsquo;t ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that conclusion Bumpus wheeled and once
more started along the road. He increased his pace
almost to a run, so eager was he to come upon Thad
and Allan before they finished dressing the wounds
of the unfortunate ambulance driver and put him
aboard some passing van.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward Bumpus believed he glimpsed
those whom he was yearning to see. At least he
discovered figures at one side of the dusty road when
passing vehicles allowed him the opportunity, and
they seemed to be bending over some object which
he could easily believe might be the driver. Yes,
and now he made sure of it, because who else would
be wearing that well-known khaki uniform with the
equally familiar battered campaign hats?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>It was with a lively sense of gratification that
Bumpus hurried along, and presently saw Allan
wave his hand in a way to testify that he had recognized
the stout chum. Thad, too, looked up and
gave him a welcoming smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, stranger, where have you sprung from?&rdquo;
asked Allan, as the wheezing Bumpus joined them.</p>
<p>Apparently the scouts had managed to stop the
flow of blood and had bound the injured arm of the
driver with more or less skill. The poor chap looked
white and weak, yet his eyes glowed with fire, and
Bumpus believed there could be no doubt about his
getting over his accidental wounding. It might have
proven a fatal injury, though, if not taken just in
time, for the man had lost a great deal of blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I got lost, all right, just as Giraffe said I
would,&rdquo; replied Bumpus cheerfully, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve had a
whole lot of queer adventures which I&rsquo;ll tell you
about later on. What are you meaning to do with
this poor chap, fellows? I met Giraffe down the
road and he told me how I&rsquo;d find you here, so I
hurried along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a van coming,&rdquo; explained Thad, &ldquo;and
we&rsquo;ll put him aboard if they&rsquo;ll make a little room.
He can explain who he is and how one of our crowd
has taken his place on the ambulance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allan stopped the motor truck. It was a large
affair which had probably carried ammunition to the
front; now it was taking back the fruits of that
sort of deadly business in the shape of grievously
wounded soldiers; as Allan put it, &ldquo;cause and effect.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>The man in charge happened to understand
enough English to grasp what Allan attempted to
tell him about the wounded driver. Upon examination
it was found that there was not an inch of
room inside the truck, for the injured men lay as
thickly as they could be placed. But the driver told
them he had a seat that might accommodate two in
a pinch, and moreover, he could part of the time
keep an arm around the other.</p>
<p>So they hastened to help the wounded Red Cross
driver to climb aboard. He vainly tried to thank
them for what they had done for him, but his smile
was enough to satisfy those scouts. Then the big
van pulled out and the three boys were left on the
road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, tell us what you&rsquo;ve been doing, Bumpus,&rdquo;
urged Allan, doubtless fairly consumed with boyish
curiosity, after hearing the returned wanderer
say what he had about meeting with strange adventures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, what about yourselves&mdash;from what Giraffe
flung at me as he was starting off again I
reckon you&rsquo;ve got some plan or other afoot, and that
it&rsquo;s connected with this same field-hospital work.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, that&rsquo;s about the size of it,&rdquo; returned
Allan, seeing that Bumpus, who was very stubborn,
would not budge an inch until he had complied with
this reasonable request. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here and want to
see more of what&rsquo;s going on, and as scouts always
expect to make themselves useful as well as ornamental,
why we fixed it up to offer our services to
the Red Cross, if so be they&rsquo;d take us on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! then that accounts for Giraffe taking the
place of the injured driver, eh?&rdquo; Bumpus went on
to say. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a funny coincidence, but do you
know as I walked along the road even before I met
Giraffe I was thinking of that very same thing. I
guess it must have struck me because those old
monks were so benevolent, and, as I understand it,
spend most all their time trying to help suffering
humanity along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monks!&rdquo; ejaculated Allan in astonishment, &ldquo;what
under the sun do you mean by saying that, Bumpus?
Is it apes or men you&rsquo;re talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s part of my story, you see,&rdquo; came
the quick reply; &ldquo;and while we&rsquo;re on our way toward
the front in search of a field hospital I&rsquo;ll tell
you all that happened to me since we separated last
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This he proceeded to do, and the boys were of
course deeply interested in the recital. On the whole,
they considered that Bumpus had a very remarkable
experience. And no doubt they could appreciate his
feelings when, upon being awakened by that weird
chant in the courtyard below, he looked from his
window and witnessed the strange burial procession
of the departed monk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you found a chance to tell those good
Brothers something about the success of the scout
movement over in America,&rdquo; Thad observed after
the other had come to where he met Giraffe so unexpectedly
on the road driving an ambulance in the
direction of distant Paris. &ldquo;I say this, because
from what I&rsquo;ve heard, the people over on this side
of the water don&rsquo;t understand what we&rsquo;re doing
along the lines of our work. In my mind it goes
away ahead of anything they dream of here, where
the scouts are only a minor military organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, the movement was started in England,
we&rsquo;ve got to remember, by Baden-Powell, the hero
of the Boer war,&rdquo; suggested Allan. &ldquo;And then again,
conditions are altogether different over here. We
have no cause to fear our neighbors north or south,
and two oceans separate us from other really powerful
nations. If we had near neighbors who envied
us our wealth, perhaps scouts in our country would
have a connection with the military authorities too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talking in this strain they continued to push on.
And all the while that stream of laden vehicles kept
going and coming, for no van was allowed to speed
back to the city without its full quota of injured
soldiers aboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where in the wide world they&rsquo;ll ever
find room to accommodate them in the hospital beds
of Paris?&rdquo; Bumpus exclaimed, appalled by this
never-ceasing string of ambulances and vans and
lorries of every description that passed them by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! they&rsquo;ve been opening up temporary hospitals
in lots of places, I should say,&rdquo; Thad explained.
&ldquo;And, besides, many will go beyond Paris. The
trains for the south of France that have carried
troops to the capital to assist in its defense will
take wounded men back to Boulogne, Lyons and all
those places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no easy task talking with all that clamor
going on; and, really, as the minutes passed it seemed
to be growing steadily in volume with fresh batallions
and batteries coming into action. Never in
any known war were such monster guns used, and
as to number, they outclassed all previous records
by ten or twenty to one. Even at that this was
but the beginning. Two years later, when the struggle
along the trenches of the Aisne carried through
a whole summer, this number was destined to be
multiplied many times over.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that the very air throbbed and
pulsated under the almost continuous blasts. No
wonder that a strange halo surrounded the sun the
live-long day as sulphurous fumes continued to rise
in ever-increasing volume.</p>
<p>There did not seem to be five seconds at a stretch
when they could not observe some monster shell
bursting over the entrenchments of the French or
throwing up those dirt geysers where it lodged in
the earth before exploding. And all the while the
French batteries were also sending out their compliments
toward the German lines, trying to ferret out
the places where the Teuton regiments were lying
in wait for the order to attack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Thad knew just where he was going. He was not
the one to enter into a thing blindly, and doubtless
before the injured driver of the ambulance was sent
on his way he had told the scout leader just where
to come upon the field hospital from which he had
taken his load.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must turn off the road here,&rdquo; Thad informed
the others. &ldquo;You can see that only the vans from
Paris keep on beyond this point with their loads of
ammunition and supplies. The ambulances and
those vehicles used as such are coming out of this
lane. It leads to the hospital, so come on, and we&rsquo;ll
soon be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Allan and Bumpus increased their pace.
They looked deeply interested, but at the same time
there was a sort of peaked expression about the
face of the stout boy which Thad, noticing, caused
him to say, as he smiled into the eyes of Bumpus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now be sure and keep a stiff upper lip, old chum,
because like as not we&rsquo;ll run across some pretty
gruesome sights here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, Thad,&rdquo; Bumpus hastened to
tell him; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got considerable grit when it comes
down to standing things, and I mean to go through
with this business no matter how it pulls. You&rsquo;ll
find me game, all right, boys, I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">AT THE FRENCH HOSPITAL</span></h2>
<p>They were soon at the border of the French field
hospital. It was only natural that Thad and his
comrades should survey the scene with a wonder
closely approaching awe. They had passed through
a good many strange experiences during the past
two years, as we happen to know, but never before
had their eyes taken in such a remarkable picture as
that now spread out before them.</p>
<p>The French Red Cross Corps had picked out this
position for the emergency hospital with an eye
both to convenience and safety. While it was close
enough to the battle line to prove of vast service,
and wounded men could be carried to the operating
tables without much loss of precious minutes; at
the same time it was at an angle where the numerous
white flags with the sacred Red Cross might easily
be seen from the German lines.</p>
<p>No cannon were allowed near by, so that every
excuse for shells dropping in that sector had apparently
been avoided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>It was a busy scene that the boys gazed upon.
Streams of men with stretchers passed back and
forth, those coming in bearing burdens and those
going out after others.</p>
<p>Ambulances, vans and all manner of wheeled
vehicles were moving this way and that, loading up
with their human freight that was to be transported
forthwith to the hospitals of Paris and beyond.</p>
<p>Bustling surgeons could be seen. Bumpus quailed
at the sight of their stained aprons. He felt as
though he were in close touch with a butcher shop;
but not by a word or a whimper did he disclose the
dreadful feeling that so nearly overwhelmed his
rapidly beating heart.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this apparent confusion haste
seemed to be the only predominant requisite. The
wounded were streaming in so fast that only superficial
attention could be paid to individual cases.
Machine-like work was the order of the day. Army
surgeons, when the battle is on, cannot appear humane.
They must do their necessary work methodically,
for they are engaged in a wholesale business
where sympathy can have little part.</p>
<p>But the boys did not mean to stand there gaping
for long. Thad and Allan were resolved to find
some part in the great work of serving suffering
humanity. This was a task that even neutrals could
engage in. They would just as readily assist in
binding up the wounds of a German prisoner as a
French hero; it made no difference.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>So Thad led the way into the midst of those
grewsome sights, dodging several moving vans that
were coming or going, their drivers shouting at the
top of their voices, for even here the roar of the
raging battle was strenuous.</p>
<p>Perhaps Bumpus would have liked to stand a bit
and cast his eyes far across the open country to
where the smoky pall was hovering and the opposing
armies struggled in a death grip; but Thad
meant business, and the time for watching stirring
events had temporarily passed.</p>
<p>The field hospital had been laid out on rising
ground. This was to allow the enemy a full chance
to mark the spot, so that their guns might not drop
shells in that particular quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; exclaimed Allen just then, &ldquo;some one is
talking good old United States over yonder, Thad!
Think of our running across an American here of
all places, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be one of the surgeons!&rdquo; the scout leader
declared. &ldquo;Perhaps he was in Paris at the time and
volunteered to come out and work under the Red
Cross. That is always permissible, you know. Even
neutrals can help the wounded, which is why we&rsquo;re
here right now. There, I&rsquo;ve placed the party, and
from the way others consult him I guess he&rsquo;s the
head surgeon, in this section of the hospital, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>Of course it was the sensible thing for Thad to do
to try and get in touch with the English-speaking
operator, who would much more readily understand
their desire to do something than a French doctor
could.</p>
<p>The busy surgeon looked up at their approach. He
was, of course, considerably surprised at seeing
three lads clad in faded khaki; a bustling field hospital
did not seem to be just the place for youngsters
of this type. His astonishment jumped to a still
higher notch, however, when the foremost boy spoke
to him in English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are American Boy Scouts, sir, who by accident
happen to be caught over here between the two
armies. One of our number has even now taken
an ambulance on to Paris, for the regular driver was
sorely wounded. The rest of us fixed up his hurts
and sent him on board a loaded van. That gave us
the idea we might make ourselves useful while
trapped here between the lines. We&rsquo;ve been trained
as Scouts to give first aid, you see, sir, and if you
could tell us what to do we&rsquo;d be ready to start in
right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There happened to be a temporary lull in business.
The hard-worked head surgeon could afford to give
these remarkable boys a minute or two of his precious
time. His grim face broke into a half-smile,
as though their coming had been in the nature of
a breath of fresh air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, my boy,&rdquo; he said energetically.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m also an American, from New York City. Just
now I&rsquo;m devoting my whole energies to looking after
these poor fellows who come out of the shambles;
no matter on which side they fought, it is all the
same to me. A surgeon has no right to be partisan
at a time like this. To be sure I can make you useful,
for we are suffering from a lack of attendants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He immediately assigned them to a certain work
that he expected they could attend to, and which in
a measure would relieve his assistants. A sudden
fresh rush of new patients caused the head surgeon
to leave the three scouts to their work; but ever and
anon as he labored feverishly he found occasion to
glance toward where Thad, ably backed by Allan
and Bumpus, was bandaging less severe wounds, and
from the gleam in the surgeon&rsquo;s eye and the faint
smile on his face it looked as though he felt highly
pleased with their methods of procedure.</p>
<p>Thad put his whole soul into his work. His previous
experience profited him now to a certain extent,
and by the time half an hour had passed he
felt as though he were a veteran along the line of
wrapping up cuts and abrasions.</p>
<p>Even Bumpus no longer felt that horrid squeamishness
such as had attacked him at first. They say
&ldquo;familiarity breeds contempt,&rdquo; but while this would
hardly apply in the present case, at least it hardened
the stout boy&rsquo;s nerves to a wonderful extent, so that
he could even do some of the bandaging himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>The battle meanwhile ebbed and flowed by turns.
They could not tell how things were going, though
at times loud yellings came floating to their ears, as
though one side or the other might have found cause
for rejoicing. Thad had some reason for believing
that the French must be holding their ground wonderfully
well; at least he had seen no direct signs
of a retreat.</p>
<p>Batteries now and then swept past to take fresh
positions. They respected that magical flag flying
there on the rise, though doubtless many a captain
of a gun thought what a splendid position that would
be to shell the distant lines of the enemy. Such
an act, though, would have been contrary to all recognized
rules of civilized warfare. They must
scrupulously observe these so as to avoid giving the
German batteries the slightest excuse for turning
their guns in this quarter and raining fresh ruin
and death upon the inmates of the emergency field
hospital.</p>
<p>Once during another little lull in the almost constant
succession of patients the noted American surgeon
stepped over to where the three scouts were
busily engaged. He gave them what he undoubtedly
meant to be a smile of encouragement, although his
face was so grim with his terrible work that it
seemed almost out of place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want to commend you boys for your ability in
care of ordinary wounds,&rdquo; he told Thad as he came
up after glancing at the splendid way in which the
bandage had been placed around a torn arm. &ldquo;It
does great credit to the organization to which you
belong. I never dreamed it could be doing such
a grand work among our boys over in America.
After this I shall have only words of commendation
for the Boy Scout movement. It has come to stay
as the greatest uplift ever devised for the rising generation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad reddened under this eloquent praise. It was
certainly worth all the trouble they had endured just
to hear this splendid professional man utter such
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish,&rdquo; continued the tired surgeon, after
Thad had thanked him as best he was able, &ldquo;that
I had the time to hear your story, for I&rsquo;m very
sure it must be worth listening to; perhaps later on
I may do so while resting. But here comes another
batch of poor fellows needing attention. Keep right
on doing as you are, my boys. Grateful France will
thank you for every wound you bind up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he left them and resumed his grewsome
labors. Other cases came to the three chums
from time to time; in fact, they were kept constantly
employed, for a constant stream of injured continued
to flow to the field hospital. Those German
guns wrought terrific damage with their accurately
placed fire, and when batallions of the blue came in
contact with others wearing the Kaiser&rsquo;s gray and
the machine guns spat out their deadly hail the list
of casualties mounted higher and higher as the
day wore on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Bumpus, in the midst of his work, found occasion
to wonder how Giraffe might be coming on. Had
he managed to reach the hospital in Paris and deliver
his human freight, and would he start back again
toward the front along that congested road to
once more receive an allotment of the freshly
wounded?</p>
<p>And then Bumpus indulged in rainbow chasing or
building air castles when he allowed himself to
imagine an accidental meeting on the streets of
Paris between Giraffe and his sick mother, Mrs.
Hawtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course that&rsquo;d be next door to a miracle,&rdquo; Bumpus
admitted to himself candidly: &ldquo;but then it&rsquo;s
possible at that. And it&rsquo;d be fine for Giraffe to let
Ma know her darling boy was safe and sound and
just now as busy as a beaver, helping poor chaps
along! Oh! well, before a great while I hope to be in
Paris myself, when I can look her up. Sooner or
later there&rsquo;ll come along a chance to ride with a
driver, and if Thad thinks it&rsquo;s all right I guess I&rsquo;ll
go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Then he started in to labor with more vim than
ever, as though determined to &ldquo;make hay while the
sun shone.&rdquo; Truth to tell, few fellows could put
their whole soul into any work of mercy better than
Bumpus, who was known among his mates as an
exceedingly tender-hearted chap.</p>
<p>It was while these things were going on with the
momentum and precision of a great machine, the
wounded coming and going in constant streams, that
a sudden and startling interruption occurred.</p>
<p>Thad at the time had just finished bandaging the
leg of a young French soldier, who bore the excruciating
pain with the stoicism of a hero. He had
made an especially decent job of the operation, according
to his way of looking at it, and the patient
thanked him in voluble French, which, of course,
Thad could only partly understand.</p>
<p>Thinking to get him in one of the vans that were
loading, Thad had just turned and half-risen to his
feet when he experienced a rude shock. Close by
there came a most terrific explosion. The earth
flew high in the air in a shower that resembled a
miniature geyser. No doubt considerable damage
was done and a number of men either killed or
maimed, while several horses immediately tried to
run away, adding to the confusion.</p>
<p>Thad knew what this meant without being told.
A German shell, the first that had been sent anywhere
near the field hospital, had fallen in their
midst and wrought much ruin. That was not the
worst. For some reason unknown the German gunfire
had been suddenly raised, and there was a strong
likelihood that other terrible shells would follow
that leader, rendering the position untenable!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>No wonder, then, that consternation filled the
hearts of the working surgeons as they held their
breath while waiting to see if the blow would be
repeated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">THE SCOUTS UNDER FIRE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! there comes another shell! Duck; fellows;
duck, quick!&rdquo; almost shrieked Bumpus, as a strange
and terrifying sound was heard in the air above
them.</p>
<p>Then followed a second frightful crash. The
very ground seemed quaking under the feet of the
boys. They could see the havoc this German missile
had wrought almost alongside one of the operating
tables. Bumpus turned as white as a ghost and
looked as though ready to collapse.</p>
<p>Immediately consternation bordering on a panic
took possession of all in that unlucky field hospital.
No one could understand why the German gunfire
had been so suddenly raised and sent in this quarter.
Thad glanced hurriedly toward the little rise. The
big white flag with its crimson cross still floated
there, and each successive waft of the passing breeze
opened its folds, so that surely it could be readily
seen miles away when glasses were used.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>Whether it came about through some misunderstanding
or confusion of orders on the part of the
enemy mattered little to those who were thus exposed
to death by the change in the bombardment.</p>
<p>The head surgeon grasped the situation at once.
He knew that to remain there longer was simple
folly. The field hospital must move back half a mile
or so to the second position that had been selected,
and that while under fire.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, even as he was trying to give orders
to this effect, other shells continued to drop all
around them. Some of them fell outside the confines
of the camp, which was a most fortunate thing;
but there were others not so merciful, and again and
again did terrible damage follow.</p>
<p>All was excitement and apparent confusion. In
vain did the surgeons try to assuage the wild fear
that possessed the attendants. More than a few had
already been mowed down by those mighty engines
of destruction that in bursting knew neither friend
nor foe, patient, doctor or nurse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>Vans were being hastily loaded and driven away
in mad haste, as if the ruling passion in each and
every heart just then was to get beyond range of
those constantly falling shells. There were several
French female nurses in the camp. These brave
women seemed ready to sacrifice their own lives in
order to leave room in some of the vans for the
wounded. But they were not allowed to thus immolate
themselves on the altar of duty. French chivalry
could not stand for such a sacrifice, and, accordingly,
they were actually seized, and struggling
still against going, thrust into a van that was just
starting. The last the wondering boys saw of them
those nurses of the Red Cross were still endeavoring
to make their captors let them get out of the
van so as to make room for poor wounded privates
of the line. Certainly Thad and his mates would
never be able to get that wonderful picture out of
their minds, for it seemed the crowning act of fidelity,
well worth mentioning in history.</p>
<p>Of course the three boys were not unmindful of
the fact that it behooved them to depart from that
dangerous section as fast as they were able.</p>
<p>Thad could not find the heart to try to take up
room aboard any of the struggling vehicles, where
every bit of space was needed for others far less able
to get on than themselves. So long as their legs
were serviceable he believed it to be their duty to
make use of them. Surely they would have about
as much chance of escaping those dropping shells
as any who took to the road in vehicles.</p>
<p>Already many had gone, the surgeons lingering
despite the increasing peril, so as to see the very
last of their patients on the way before they would
consent to departing. Some of them might stay
too long, for at any moment a shell was apt to explode
directly over headquarters and annihilate the
entire staff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;We had better be on the jump!&rdquo; was what Thad
shouted in the ear of Allan, after they had watched
these thrilling sights for several minutes and twice
narrowly escaped dire injuries when explosions occurred
close by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; echoed the other, also plainly unnerved
by what he was witnessing; &ldquo;but where is
Bumpus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words gave Thad a strange sinking in the
region of his heart. True enough, their stout chum
had mysteriously vanished; and yet he could remember
seeing Bumpus near by only a brief time before.</p>
<p>Had some cruel missile from one of the bursting
shells cut him down? Look as he might, this way
and that, Thad failed to discover any sign of the
corpulent figure of his most beloved chum. It was
always possible, he figured, that poor Bumpus might
have been hurled far to one side by the shock, but
though he strained his eyes to the utmost to discover
his form he met with no success whatever.</p>
<p>It was a mystery. Surrounded by such a mad
clamor, with men dashing this way and that as
though temporarily out of their minds, it was not
strange that Thad should feel faint with apprehension.
He seemed to see himself telling the poor
mother how her gallant boy had yielded up his young
life in the effort to alleviate suffering on the part of
others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;What ought we do, Thad, go, or stick it out and
hunt for Bumpus?&rdquo; Allan was calling close to his
ear.</p>
<p>Thad hardly knew at first what to answer. He
despised himself for even allowing a thought to
come into his mind as to deserting a comrade in
time of peril, and yet in a measure it seemed sheer
madness to remain while that tempest of iron was
being hurled upon the spot.</p>
<p>As in a dream he saw the American surgeon up
there on the rise gathering the Red Cross flag in his
arms, as though he meant to carry it away with him
to the new quarters. It was an act of daring that
gave Thad a little thrill; but then at that moment so
much was going on that bordered along the heroic
that he could only take passing notice of this particular
deed.</p>
<p>As a last resort, which perhaps might be called an
inspiration on his part, Thad raised his voice and
shouted as loud as he could:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bumpus! Bumpus! Bumpus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three separate times did he launch that name, and
then both Thad and Allan were thrilled to catch a
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am, Thad!&rdquo; shouted a high-pitched voice,
and with the words a head appeared above the edge
of a deep shell crater not thirty feet away, as
Bumpus commenced to laboriously crawl on hands
and knees out of the hole.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Of course it looked as though he had dropped
down there with the idea that by so doing he might
better escape the danger of being caught in the rain
of iron splinters following each explosion. Really
it was not such a bad scheme on the part of Bumpus,
and had they been compelled to stay there longer
the others might have copied his example with profit
to themselves.</p>
<p>Thad hurriedly beckoned in order to hasten the
coming of the other scout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to cut and run for it, don&rsquo;t you
see?&rdquo; he bellowed.</p>
<p>That nerved Bumpus to new exertions, so that he
speedily emerged from the pit, little the worse for
his experience. Later on he candidly admitted that
it had not been wholly a clever idea of his own. In
fact, he had been blasted into the hole by the sudden
concussion of air when a shell burst near by, and,
finding himself prone at the bottom, hugged the
ground until he could feel himself all over and
ascertain whether he were still sound of body
and limb.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>By that time the field hospital was pretty well
deserted, of the living, that is to say. Looking
around for the last time Thad could see numerous
still forms on the ground, and he knew that death
had reaped a heavy harvest. Just then he hated
the German gunners most violently, although later
on, when he cooled down, he realized that it must
have all been a terrible mistake, for surely they
would never think of bombarding a field hospital,
always held sacred between honorable foes.</p>
<p>When the three boys hurried out of the camp the
shells were still falling as if they meant to honeycomb
that sector thoroughly for some reason. Perhaps
a signal had gone wrong, and it was believed
that one of the most dangerous batteries of the
French lay concealed under branches at this point.</p>
<p>Thad never knew the truth about it; in fact, no
one could learn the reason why. Just then the one
main object they had in view was to put as great
a distance between themselves and that harried
ground as possible.</p>
<p>Amidst a jumble of wagons, vans, ambulances,
motor lorries and ordinary cars, all striving to push
along that one narrow thoroughfare, the three scouts
pressed on. One shell had dropped squarely in the
road and made such a yawning gap that it was necessary
for each vehicle to go around the aperture.
A van had also been wrecked at the same time, for
the boys could see dreadful signs of this whichever
way they turned their eyes.</p>
<p>Presently, however, they seemed to be getting beyond
the curtain of fire which the big German guns
had established. That would mean the danger was
over. Bumpus began to get back a little of his lost
color when he discovered this pleasing fact; and
for that matter, both of the other boys felt better.
It was certainly anything but a laughing matter, running
the gantlet of those fearful explosives and
amidst such desolating scenes in the bargain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Half a mile and more they had gone when Thad
made a discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re coming to the new camp at last!&rdquo;
he called out, pointing as he spoke; and as Bumpus
was all out of breath on account of their hurry he
heard this latest news with considerable relief.</p>
<p>As they drew still nearer they could see that already
the energetic medical staff had started to work
erecting their shelters under which the operating
tables would be placed as fast as they arrived, when
the emergency field hospital might be said to be
ready for business again.</p>
<p>The brave nurses were there, attending to the
sorely wounded as fast as they could be taken from
conveyances; yes, and just back of the boys came
the head surgeon, bag in one hand, doubtless containing
his instruments, and the Red Cross banner
thrown over his left shoulder. Thad felt like giving
the palm to this valiant soul, that could not be
daunted by any personal peril, but had stuck to his
self-imposed duty through shot and shell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>Again the work went on as though there had not
been any interruption. The men with the stretchers
had further to go, bearing their burdens, which made
it so much the harder; but most of them looked on
these things as the fortunes of war. It is of little
use to complain when a battle is on. Conditions and
not theories are what confront men then, and it
becomes necessary to make the best of a bad
situation.</p>
<p>Once again Thad and his two mates found abundant
ways for making themselves useful. And
although they might be haunted a long time by the
things they were compelled to gaze upon, not one
of them would ever regret coming as they did to the
assistance of the Red Cross unit at that fiercely contested
Battle of the Marne.</p>
<p>It was in the midst of all this that a strange thing
happened to Thad and his two comrades. Just why
it should come their way instead of to any other
worker in the field hospital was one of those inscrutable
mysteries that can never be explained, but
then those boys had always been fortunate in the
past about monopolizing things of importance, and
perhaps their luck still held good over here in a
strange land.</p>
<p>It chanced that they were rushed at the near-by
operating table when a man wearing the French blue
was brought in terribly injured. Thad could see
that he had not been wounded by shell-fire, or
through a bayonet thrust; in fact, he presented the
appearance of one who had been caught in a collision
of some sort, so that his arms were broken and his
head badly lacerated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Having nothing else on his hands just then, Thad
felt constrained to see what he could do in order to
alleviate the intense suffering which the poor fellow
he felt sure must be enduring.</p>
<p>Up to then the man had been senseless, but his
eyes opened as soon as Thad commenced to examine
his broken arms. The boy believed he had never
seen such mental agony as was depicted on that
seamed and blood-stained face of the soldier, who
bore the marks of a subordinate officer.</p>
<p>He started to say something in French, and while
Thad could not understand its full import, he caught
a significant word here and there that alarmed him.
One of these was &ldquo;dispatches,&rdquo; and another phrase
plainly stood for &ldquo;Life and death!&rdquo; These things
excited the boy. He started across to speak to the
American surgeon about it, leaving his comrades
beside the officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would step this way for a minute,
sir,&rdquo; Thad called out, after he had succeeded in
catching the busy surgeon&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it all about, my boy?&rdquo; demanded the
other, laying down his instrument as a patient was
lifted from the table and taken in charge by attendants,
who proceeded to bandage his wounds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an officer just brought in, sir, badly
hurt,&rdquo; explained Thad. &ldquo;I think he must have been
caught in a collision, for he has both arms broken
and his head is badly lacerated in the bargain. But
he seems to have something terrible on his mind.
I imagine he must have been carrying some sort of
important papers at the time he was caught, for he
speaks of dispatches and acts so wild I thought you
ought to know about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The surgeon looked intensely interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show him to me, please, and I&rsquo;ll quickly find out
what he wants,&rdquo; he told the scout, who immediately
led him over to where the man was lying, waiting
his turn at the surgeon&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>The weary doctor bent down and spoke in excellent
French. Thad listened, and what little he managed
to hear pass between the two gave him a new
thrill. Hence he was not as surprised as Allan and
Bumpus when the surgeon, rising to his feet, hastened
to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were correct in your diagnosis, son; he is
a dispatch-bearer. Even now he has a most important
paper intended for the hands of General
Joffre himself. He tells me that if it fails to be
delivered immediately the most dire results may follow
for the whole French army. He begs me most
piteously to send some reliable person forward with
this dispatch. I hardly know to whom I can entrust
it unless you brave scouts will undertake the mission.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">MAKING HISTORY</span></h2>
<p>The three chums exchanged looks when the surgeon
made this extraordinary request. At least it
proved what confidence he had in their ability to
carry out the work of delivering the interrupted
dispatches. Had there really been any one else
handy in whom he could trust possibly the American
surgeon would never have thought of imposing
such an arduous duty upon Thad and his comrades.
It was really a Frenchman&rsquo;s task and hardly fitted
for those who considered themselves neutral in the
battle that was going on.</p>
<p>Somehow or other Thad quite forgot that just
then. The mere fact that he had been asked to do
this thing appealed to all that was valiant in him;
and we happen to know that times without number
he had proven himself the possessor of red blood in
his veins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say yes, Thad!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>That was Allan urging him to accept, and yet in
times past this same Allan had often betrayed unusual
signs of caution. He, too, must have been
overwhelmed with a sense of the high honor thus
suddenly thrust upon them; though, for that matter,
the tragic events of the day would have been
quite enough to make those lads feel that they were
enlisted heart and soul in the cause of the
Allies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he come to be hurt, sir?&rdquo; asked Thad,
first of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was riding a motorcycle at mad speed when
a van crossed in the way,&rdquo; explained the surgeon
promptly. &ldquo;The result was bad for the messenger,
since his machine was smashed and he himself hurled
against the van. They found him there, doubled up
in the road, and carried him back to us. That is all
I have learned, except that he has plain directions
where Headquarters can be found. He will give
them to me as soon as any one swears to carry his
dispatches through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad, we ought to do it, sure as anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why, if it wasn&rsquo;t Bumpus himself who was saying
that; and surely if the stout chum felt that a duty
had been thrust upon them that they ought not attempt
to shirk, Thad should be the last one to hold
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll undertake to deliver the dispatches, sir,
though of course it&rsquo;s none of our business what their
nature is,&rdquo; he immediately told the waiting surgeon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine of you, but no more than I expected,
son,&rdquo; the other hastened to tell him; and then, once
more bending down closer to the wounded officer,
he commenced to talk with him.</p>
<p>They guessed that he was asking for the directions
as well as where he would find the dispatches
secreted about the person of the wounded man.
Presently the surgeon stood up again. He was holding
a small packet in his hand, and it looked as
though it might be of importance, seeing that it was
wrapped in yellow, water-proof material such as
Thad remembered sailors&rsquo; garments were made of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the packet you are to place in the hands
of General Joffre personally and as quickly as you
can get to Headquarters. If they could have been
sent by aeroplane it would have been done, but that
means was not available. I am putting a great trust
in your hands, my boy; see that you carry it through
as becomes a true-hearted American Scout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad without any hesitation accepted the packet
and hastened to conceal it upon his person. It must
have struck him that in so doing he was taking more
or less risk, for should he happen to be caught by
any raiding German column he would be treated
harshly, and might even be looked upon as a spy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, sir, how about the directions?&rdquo; he
asked quietly, trying to keep his voice well under
control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give them to you plainly, and I request all
of you to listen carefully, so that if one should forget
another can remedy the defect.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Then the surgeon proceeded to describe just how
the course was to be followed; telling how many
miles they would proceed along a certain road, how
they were to know where to branch off, and, finally,
taking them to an obscure spot far in the rear of
the French battle-line, where the great General
Joffre had his headquarters, sending most of his
orders forth by telephone, or it might be aeroplanes,
which, it appears, is the modern way of conducting a
great engagement between hundreds of thousands
of combatants on either side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you can remember it all clearly
now?&rdquo; demanded the surgeon, when he had finished
his instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it printed like a map in my mind,&rdquo; said
Thad. &ldquo;Scouts are taught to do that sort of thing,
you know, sir; and unless something we don&rsquo;t count
on hits us a hard blow we&rsquo;ll get to General Joffre&rsquo;s
headquarters all right. Now please make some arrangement
for a vehicle. Can you get us a car, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you are used to driving one?&rdquo; queried
the other with a smile; he had apparently taken a
most decided fancy to Thad, and deep down in his
heart believed the wide-awake lad could do almost
anything that was possible for the best of them to
attempt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, we know a whole lot about such things,
sir;&rdquo; Thad assured him; &ldquo;but I hope we have better
luck than with an old rattletrap affair we got hold
of along the Rhine when we heard war had broken
out and tried to break through the lines so as to
reach Antwerp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what can be done,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>His word was law in the field hospital, and hence
Thad was not at all surprised when he saw him take
possession of the best car in sight. The owner, an
old though patriotic Frenchman, who had been
urgent in trying to do all he could to assist in taking
care of the wounded, even to risking his own life
in the cause, upon hearing why his car was wanted,
instantly handed it over to the good American surgeon,
to whom all France would later give praise
for his wonderful work during those dark days
along the Marne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s beckoning to us, Thad!&rdquo; called out Bumpus,
who seemed to be intensely interested in the adventure,
which appealed to that natural love for
excitement such as dwells in the heart of the average
boy.</p>
<p>When they hurried over to where the surgeon
waited he gave them each his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, boys, a pretty decent car placed
at your service by this gallant citizen of France.
If you live to get through, let us hear from you. As
for the car, turn it over to the military authorities
to use as they see best. Its owner has already dedicated
it to the service of his country and does not
expect to ever see it again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get in, Bumpus, and hurry!&rdquo; urged Allan, impatient
to be off on the run which might mean so
much for the French cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, get away quick as you can, boys,&rdquo; said the
surgeon, &ldquo;before I have a chance to change my mind.
Even now my heart misgives me, and I begin to feel
doubts as to whether I am doing just the right thing
in letting you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon hearing him talk in that strain both the
others scrambled aboard with all haste. They did
not mean to give him a chance to go back on his
word if it could possibly be avoided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fear for us, sir,&rdquo; Thad told him, as he
grasped the wheel and took a look so as to familiarize
himself with the working of the car, which,
of course, differed from any other which he had
ever handled, being of French make. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re accustomed
to getting whatever we go after, and this
sort of thing doesn&rsquo;t feaze us one whit. Good-bye,
sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, boys, and the best of luck go with
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they were off, for Thad had started the
motor going while talking, and it required only a
simple movement of his hand to complete the operation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Allan and Bumpus might look back and wave
their hands to the kindly surgeon, but Thad, as the
pilot at the wheel, had his work cut out for him elsewhere.
It was no easy task to thread his way in
among the numerous vehicles in motion without a
collision of some sort. The road was close at hand,
however, and once on that he would have things
easier. At times fair speed might be made, though
often they must follow in the wake of a clumsy
laden van because the other side of the road was
taken up completely with vehicles going to the front.</p>
<p>And now they could no longer see the field hospital,
since a spur of land hid it from the view of
those who looked back; but they would often have
distinct visions of that amazing picture in days to
come, and always must find indelibly stamped upon
the picture the face of that noble American surgeon
who gave all that was in him for the cause of suffering
humanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re off at last!&rdquo; said Bumpus, when they
found themselves gliding along the road smoothly,
dodging trouble as it loomed up in the shape of
puffing motor trucks and lorries, both French and
English, all packed to the limit with such supplies
as a vast army must have day by day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And say, this machine is a big improvement on
that old shebang we ran up there in Belgium a while
back,&rdquo; added Allan with a smack of satisfaction in
his manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;The proof of the pudding is in the eating of it,&rdquo;
Thad told him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t crow too soon, boys. It
may turn out that I&rsquo;ll wreck the car in some way
before I&rsquo;m done, though you can bet your last cent
I&rsquo;m going to be mighty careful. We&rsquo;re making history
right now, come to think of it, and can&rsquo;t afford
to take chances.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">THAD TURNS MAGICIAN</span></h2>
<p>Their troubles began almost as soon as they
struck the road. Owing to the fact that there was
an almost constant stream of motors and other vehicles
going and coming, it took on the aspect of
a moving procession.</p>
<p>Thad was compelled to fall in line and curb his
impatience as best he could. Of course, at the same
time, he remained on the alert for such openings as
occurred, when he might take advantage of a chance
to pass ahead, and spin along a stretch of territory
that offered the opportunity.</p>
<p>Progress was tedious, and was made all the more
so on account of the open hostility shown by many
of the truck drivers and those connected with ambulances.
These natives could not understand what
business those three boys dressed in faded khaki
could have seated in a fine car and heading apparently
toward Paris. They must have jumped to
the conclusion that Thad and his chums were out
for a lark; a trio of curious English lads who
wanted to bother everybody by trying to see some of
the fighting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>Consequently the French drivers resented this
seeming impertinence. More than that, they began
to interfere, whenever they found a chance, by
deliberately blocking the road and delaying the boys
unnecessarily. Often, too, some husky chauffeur
would call out to them in a sarcastic tone; and while
they could only guess at the import, they understood
that it was not meant for a compliment; in fact, they
were very likely being compared to &ldquo;pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad stood all this patiently for a little while.
Allan was beginning to show signs of anger, while
even gentle Bumpus fumed considerably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we do something to put a stopper on this
thing, Thad?&rdquo; finally demanded Allan, when a van
deliberately blocked their passage and the man at
the wheel thrust his bearded face out to leer back
at them impudently.</p>
<p>For reply, Thad shouted out a few words in
French, much to the surprise of both his comrades;
at the same time he made a certain sign with his
hand. Then, to the utter amazement of both Bumpus
and the other boy, the driver of the van containing
wounded heroes on the way to the Paris hospitals
hurriedly drew his vehicle aside, even going
so far as to hold up so as to allow of a free passage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>A minute later this was repeated, and again with
surprising results. No wonder simple-minded Bumpus
fairly gasped and stared hard at Thad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, since when did you practice for a magician,
Thad?&rdquo; he demanded, bent on learning the
secret of that magical pass of the hand, that majestic
signal that would have well become a king. &ldquo;Why,
look at them get out of our way, will you? Honestly,
I believe you must have hypnotized the bunch,
Thad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s that French phrase you&rsquo;re shouting
at the drivers?&rdquo; pursued Allan. &ldquo;I can only make
out the word &lsquo;Joffre&rsquo; in it all. Are you telling them
we&rsquo;ve got a dispatch for the big push at Headquarters
and that perhaps the fate of the whole
battle may depend on our getting it to him in a
hurry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve guessed it, Allan,&rdquo; admitted Thad; &ldquo;for
that is just what it means. And you can see how
those patriotic drivers understand. They no longer
see in us three happy-go-lucky schoolboys from
across the Channel, poking our noses where we
hadn&rsquo;t ought to be, and interfering with men&rsquo;s
work. Why, I feel like taking off my hat to those
chaps after seeing how they give us the road now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It works like magic, for a fact,&rdquo; said Allan,
looking happy once more; &ldquo;but how did you get on
to it, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our friend, the American surgeon, told me what
to say, and how to give that signal with my hand,&rdquo;
came the reply. &ldquo;He realized that we&rsquo;d have lots
of trouble getting along this congested road. I
think the officer who was so badly smashed must
have passed it on to the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, keep it going then, please,&rdquo; Bumpus
pleaded, &ldquo;because it seems to save us heaps and
heaps of bother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were constantly moving away from the
scene of action of course the awful clamor grew
gradually less in volume. Still the boys were of the
opinion that if the wind was favorable the citizens
of the French capital might even catch distant
sounds of apparent thunder. How it would revive
thrilling memories of those bitter days of &rsquo;71 in the
minds of the old folks who had passed through the
previous siege, and seen the heel of the proud Prussian
victor pressing their pavements in Paris.</p>
<p>Once they came to where a van heavily laden had
broken down, and blocked the entire road. With
so many vehicles passing back and forth in a constant
stream such a happening was not singular.
But those astute drivers had been equal to the occasion.
An adjoining stone wall had been torn
down so that vehicles might turn into a field, and
thus go around the block, once more reaching the
road further on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Bumpus felt relieved when he saw how easily
this difficulty had been met and conquered. Men
were even then busily engaged in repairing the van
that had caused the trouble. Had it been beyond
help they would have removed its load, and dragged
the heavy machine to one side of the road, so as
to leave a free passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how far do we keep on this route?&rdquo; Bumpus
wanted to know, presently. &ldquo;It runs direct to Paris,
I understand, and surely that isn&rsquo;t where we&rsquo;re
bound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think General Joffre has yet taken
up his headquarters so far away from the fighting
line,&rdquo; laughed Allan. &ldquo;As I understand it we&rsquo;ll soon
come to a place where we turn aside, and head
into the west; isn&rsquo;t that it, Thad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what we will,&rdquo; replied the driver; &ldquo;and
then, unless I&rsquo;m mistaken, our course will gradually
carry us back toward the front once more. We
can tell that from the direction we head for; and,
besides, as like as not the roar will begin to increase
again instead of getting softer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bumpus fell silent at that. Given his way and
no doubt he would have candidly admitted that he
had seen quite as much of fighting as he ever wanted
to look upon. The terrible things that had passed
in review before his eyes would never leave his
mind; and his heart felt heavy because of the intense
human suffering they had tried their best to
alleviate. Still Bumpus was very loyal, and so long
as these chums of his thought best to see the great
battle through he was determined not to show the
white feather.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>It was certainly amazing, the amount of traffic
that was passing back and forth along that road.
It had evidently been given over entirely to this
sort of thing; for they did not encounter any batteries
of guns, or marching regiments of troops
coming out of Paris as reinforcements on the way
to the fighting line. No doubt arrangements had
been perfected whereby all such went either by train,
or along still another main artery of travel, where
they might have an unobstructed passage conducive
to haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad, do you think we&rsquo;ll ever run across Giraffe
again?&rdquo; Bumpus suddenly asked, as though
the missing chum might have been in his mind as
he watched an empty ambulance swinging by on
their right, for vehicles abroad always pass to the
left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s to be hoped we do,&rdquo; the boy at the
wheel replied, hastily. &ldquo;If he gets back to where
the field hospital is, and meets the surgeon, who
promised to keep an eye out for Giraffe, he will
be told where we&rsquo;ve gone; also that he is to go
back to Paris, where we&rsquo;ll join him. I even left an
address with our friend, so that if it came to the
worst Giraffe would know where to find us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad, you just manage to think of nearly everything,&rdquo;
commented the admiring Bumpus, once
more looking pleased, as if some weighty doubts
had been thus removed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you said &lsquo;nearly,&rsquo;&rdquo; the scout leader
told him, &ldquo;because I&rsquo;ve got my weak points as well
as the next fellow. But here we come to another
pack; and it&rsquo;s going to take a whole lot of managing
to get through in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were making very good progress all this
while, however. Thad felt greatly encouraged. He
believed it could not be long before they arrived
at the place where they expected to leave this main
artery of travel, and strike out along the road running
parallel with the fighting line. Here the vehicular
traffic might be expected to become much
less dense, and they would be able to make better
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your eyes on the watch for an opening to
the left,&rdquo; he told the others, after they had managed
to get by the jam, and had a little clear space
ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch that ambulance coming, Thad; it seems
to wobble a bit, in the hurry of the man at the
wheel to get back to the front; and we don&rsquo;t want
any smashup at this stage of the game, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! they&rsquo;ll give us plenty of room when we get
closer,&rdquo; retorted Thad. &ldquo;With three on the seat
they ought to be able to manage things, I should
think.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;The ambulance is full of men, too,&rdquo; remarked
Allan just then. &ldquo;Just as like as not they&rsquo;re fresh
workers of the Red Cross Corps getting out on
the front line to help the tired gang we left up to
their eyes in business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, it seems to me there&rsquo;s something mighty
familiar about one of those chaps on the seat of
that machine!&rdquo; exclaimed Bumpus.</p>
<p>His words caused both the others to look closer.
Then Allan gave a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As sure as you live that&rsquo;s nobody else save our
chum, Giraffe!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d know that long
neck of his among a thousand. And see, he recognizes
us now, for he&rsquo;s grabbed the arm of the pilot
of the ambulance, and means to get him to stop.
Well, if this isn&rsquo;t luck, then we never had it come
our way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">RUNNING THE GANTLET OF SHELLS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! there, want to get aboard, Giraffe!&rdquo;
called out Bumpus, assuming all the airs of a millionaire
owner of a palatial car upon meeting a
less fortunate friend on the highway.</p>
<p>Already Giraffe had jumped from the seat of
the ambulance. His face told of the wonder that
filled his soul upon thus discovering his three comrades
occupying a commodious high-priced car, and
speeding along as though apparently bound for
Paris.</p>
<p>The ambulance started up again, and passed
them by in a cloud of dust. Giraffe lost no time
in getting aboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a desperate hurry, you see, Giraffe,&rdquo;
Bumpus assured him, even going to the extent of
reaching forward and trying to help drag the elongated
chum into the rear seat of the car, which he
had been occupying alone up to then, Allan being
in front alongside the driver.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>Thad hardly waited until Giraffe had tumbled
aboard than he was off again. The new addition
to their ranks gasped for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should say you <i>were</i> in a big hurry to
get somewhere,&rdquo; he remarked, rubbing his forehead
where it had come against the back of the
seat with a bump when the car started so suddenly.
&ldquo;Are the Germans coming so fast as that, tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked backwards rather anxiously, as though
half expecting to see some band of Uhlans charging
along in the rear.</p>
<p>Bumpus being closer than either of the others
took upon himself the task of putting the newcomer
in possession of the main facts. There was no time
to elaborate, and make a stirring story of their
late adventures, nor was Bumpus especially gifted
in that way. He did manage to explain how they
had reached the field hospital and were making
themselves useful in lots of ways when the injured
dispatch bearer was brought in.</p>
<p>When Giraffe began to understand what a strange
mission his chums had undertaken he showed the
most intense interest. Perhaps up to then he had
thought he held the palm for undertaking a remarkable
exploit, when he drove that Red Cross
ambulance, with its load of wounded soldiers, all
the way to Paris, safely delivered them at one of
the hospitals, and then turned over his charge to
another pilot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;But this beats all the other things hollow, for a
fact!&rdquo; he declared after Bumpus had managed to
give him the &ldquo;gist&rdquo; of recent events. &ldquo;To think
that you American scouts are right now carrying
dispatches for the French army, and that the delivery
of the same may mean a heap to the clinching
of victory for Joffre! Say, there&rsquo;s nothing neutral
about that, let me tell you, Bumpus. Running a
Red Cross ambulance, yes, and even helping &rsquo;em at
a field hospital may be all right; but in tackling this
you&rsquo;re making us allies of the French. They could
shoot you for doing it, if the Germans caught you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the other, confidently, &ldquo;they won&rsquo;t
catch us, all the same, I&rsquo;m telling you, Giraffe. And
Thad seemed to think it was all right. We&rsquo;re not
supposed to know what the message is we&rsquo;re carrying.
It may be a call for reinforcements over on
the left; or that the army there has to fall back.
No matter, Thad agreed to deliver it at Headquarters,
and he will, barring accidents!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Giraffe shook his head as if he did not
wholly like the idea. As his ancestors had come
from Germany many years before, and Giraffe was
known to have more or less of a tender feeling
for the cause of the Kaiser deep down in his heart,
his feelings could be understood. This matter of
strict neutrality is at best a most difficult thing to
arrange, for in almost every case thinking people
are drawn one way or the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose now, Giraffe,&rdquo; ventured Bumpus,
a minute afterwards, with a vein of entreaty
in his voice and manner, &ldquo;that you happened to see
anything of a lady in Paris who looked like my
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe laughed scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Bumpus,&rdquo; he hastened to say in a patronizing
way, &ldquo;you must know that Paris is something
more than an overgrown village. Next to our own
New York, and then London, it&rsquo;s called one of the
biggest cities in the world. Of course, right now
the people have flocked out of the same burg,
thinking Von Kluck meant to break through and
gobble up the same; but still there were plenty of
folks on the avenues, I noticed, tens of thousands,
in fact. No, Bumpus, I&rsquo;m sorry to say I didn&rsquo;t
chance to run across your mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, I hope and expect she&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo;
sighed the stout chum. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s Allan pointing
ahead. I wonder now if he&rsquo;s discovered that
side road we expect to strike along here, so as to get
to where General Joffre is holding the fort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, that&rsquo;s the game, is it?&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe.
&ldquo;Well, there <i>is</i> a road just where you see that
clump of trees. I noticed it as we came along, because
a scout is bound to use his eyes to the best
advantage when he travels, either afoot or on the
seat of an army Red Cross ambulance. Yes, and
it leads toward the east in the bargain, Bumpus.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that, because once we get off
this much traveled line we&rsquo;ll be able to make better
time,&rdquo; the other observed.</p>
<p>Presently they made the turn. It immediately
offered them a chance to speed faster, and this
pleased Thad. He seemed to have taken a strange
fancy for playing the part of the wounded dispatch
bearer. Perhaps deep down in his mind he knew
he really had no business to give that promise to
the surgeon at the field hospital; but the conditions
by which he was surrounded at the time must have
made a deep impression on him; and once having
given his word Thad could not back out. Right
or wrong he was now grimly determined on carrying
his mission to a successful termination.</p>
<p>Another point of importance soon made itself
manifest; they not only had ceased to head in the
direction of Paris, but seemed gradually swinging
around, and following an oblique course back
toward the battle line.</p>
<p>Still Thad had figured all that out before, and
for one he was not in the least surprised. It might
mean they would see still more of the furious fighting
along the Marne before they quit this region
for good.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>There were a few vehicles on the road, they
soon discovered. These must be going to another
part of the front, taking supplies. Some master
mind back there in Paris, with accurate road maps
to consult, was directing all these movements of
laden vans and wagons. Every want of the army
in the way of ammunition, food and other supplies
had to be figured on with mathematical precision.
Thad was utterly stunned whenever he tried to imagine
how all this could be done; and yet as a scout
he already knew the great value of system.</p>
<p>Louder grew the deep muttering away off there
on their left, and ahead as well, for more than
one section of Joffre&rsquo;s army of the defence was in
action on this morning, the third of the terrible
battles. Bumpus had fallen strangely silent. He
simply sat there, gripping the side of his seat, and
listening, with his heart beating very fast, as the
dreadful tattoo rose and fell like the waves of the
sea. Much as he might want to find himself face
to face with the commanding general of the French
armies, of whom he had heard so much, Bumpus
dreaded seeing those painful sights again. He was
of the opinion, and rightly too, that this disputed
ground between the lines was no proper place for
himself and chums, who would show considerably
more wisdom if they made direct for Paris, and
even beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stars! but it&rsquo;s getting pretty noisy around
here again, let me tell you,&rdquo; Giraffe called out, having
to elevate his voice considerably in order to
make himself heard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve covered a good many miles since leaving
that other road, you see,&rdquo; explained Thad, speaking
over his shoulder, &ldquo;and then, again, along here
the fighting line must lie further south than where
we left it. I can hear shells bursting; with the
roar of the big guns they muffle the sound of the
motor working, so that sometimes I almost fear it
has gone back on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while we&rsquo;re making all this speed,&rdquo; Allan
put in, sagaciously, as he glanced at the trees, and
the low stone buildings that seemed to fairly flit
past in swift succession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s all that mean ahead there, Thad?&rdquo;
suddenly asked Giraffe, he of the eagle eye; &ldquo;looks
to me like there might be quite a squad of motors
heading in our direction; and say, it also strikes
me that the man with the horses is whipping &rsquo;em like
fun in the bargain. Talk to me about a panic, that
has all the earmarks of one! What under the sun
could have happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must try and find out,&rdquo; snapped Thad. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
see if one of them won&rsquo;t give us information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But for goodness&rsquo; sake, Thad,&rdquo; said Bumpus,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t try to swing across, so as to block the road;
because they&rsquo;re coming licketty-split, and might run
right over us, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad was wise enough to foresee such a contingency.
He kept on his own side, but at the same
time slowed up, waving his hand in a way that
could have only one meaning, and that a desire for
information.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>The first van went booming past, with the man
calling something which none of them could begin
to understand, what with all the noise. A second
met with no better success. Thad now rested his
hopes on the man who had the wagon and the
team.</p>
<p>He was using his whip vigorously, so that his
steaming horses kept on a mad gallop. Upon seeing
Thad making motions, however, the man managed
to check his team somewhat, his desire to be
accommodating overcoming the mad impulse that
called for speed.</p>
<p>Thad shouted something at him, and again his
comrades caught that magic name of Joffre. It
must have reached its mark, for the driver in return
bawled as he went by them, and even turned to
point excitedly in his rear.</p>
<p>Then he too drifted along down the road. There
were no other vehicles in sight; the four chums
had the thoroughfare to themselves, to all appearances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say, Thad?&rdquo; demanded Giraffe, immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only caught a part of it,&rdquo; replied the other, soberly;
&ldquo;but I think he was trying to tell us that the
road a mile or more ahead was impassable for any
vehicle, being under the fire of the Germans. I
reckon those drivers know of another way around,
a heap longer, of course, but safer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;And will we too turn back then, Thad?&rdquo; asked
Bumpus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Allan; for I know already
how Giraffe would answer if I asked him?&rdquo; the
leader demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would mean considerable risk, if those men
didn&rsquo;t dare try it,&rdquo; commenced Allan, as though
weighing every word first before uttering it; &ldquo;but
time is worth something to us right now. Besides,
when we strike that sector that is under fire the
German batteries may have changed their range entirely,
swinging around again. We might go on
further, and see if we dare take the chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I was wanting to say myself,&rdquo; added
Thad, as he again started the car. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll move
up and take a look. If it seems too dangerous we
can give it up, and turn around again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their excitement grew by leaps and bounds as
they kept moving along the road in the direction
of the scene of danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, did you see that tree go down with a
smash?&rdquo; suddenly bawled Giraffe; &ldquo;why, a shot
must have cut it off like a knife near the base. And
see how the dirt flies up on that knoll, will you? It
was a big shell bursting in the ground that sent it
sky-rocketing. Thad, what do you think; shall we
risk it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>The boy at the wheel knew that whatever he said
those devoted chums would stand back of him to
the end. That made it all the harder for him to
decide; had he only himself to think of he could
settle the matter very quickly, one way or the other.
Bumpus did not count; and those other two seemed
willing, almost eager, to have him answer in the
affirmative. Thad took a careful survey of the
ground, and as far along the road as he could see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might chance it,&rdquo; he finally decided; &ldquo;for it
strikes me that if we can only get to where the road
seems to make another bend half a mile a long, we
ought to be out of range of the shells. They&rsquo;re
covering this road for some reason or other. Allan,
is it go, or turn back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep her moving, Thad!&rdquo; cried the one appealed
to. &ldquo;Let her out to the limit, if you think the road&rsquo;s
safe. The more speed the better our chances of
escaping being hit by any of that flying stuff.
Everybody hold on, and keep as low down as you
can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad sent the car on with a jump. All the reserve
power of the motor was thrown on; and
some of those well-built French cars do possess engines
that are capable of developing an extraordinary
capacity for business, when in the right hands.</p>
<p>It was a most intense period of time for Bumpus,
yes, and the other scouts as well. Even that
never-to-be-forgotten ride on the gun caissons of
the flying French battery when under fire would
have to take a back seat when this flight was mentioned;
and the boys at the time had thought that
the very acme of thrill-producing excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>Soon they were in the midst of the zone where
the far-away guns of the German batteries were
dropping their monster shells with almost mathematical
certainty, thanks to their wonderful rangefinders,
and the accurate maps they must possess
covering the various roads around Paris.</p>
<p>When a frightful crash came, apparently close
by over on their right, Bumpus held his breath in
awe, not knowing what the result might be. But
luckily the force of the explosion must have been
thrown in another direction, for none of them received
so much as a scratch.</p>
<p>Then another monster dropped in their rear, and
a gaping cavity appeared in the road just where
they had passed. Apparently they had come too
far to retreat now, and there seemed nothing for
them to do but keep rushing on, hoping for the best.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">AT JOFFRE&rsquo;S HEADQUARTERS</span></h2>
<p>It was worse than on the other occasion when,
seated on those gun caissons with the French soldiers,
they fled through a hurricane of bursting
shells. In connection with that never-to-be-forgotten
episode their backs were turned toward the place
from which the unseen German gunners were bombarding
the enemy lines; and consequently they
had the comforting feeling that every yard they
went the danger kept growing constantly less.</p>
<p>Now it was just the opposite, for a brief period,
since the worst was yet to come. It required a
vast amount of nerve to carry them through this
crisis. Thad had his teeth tightly clinched, and
his eyes were riveted straight on the road ahead.
Nothing must be allowed to distract his attention.
It was of vital importance that he keep the track,
and reach that bend which would offer them possible
safety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>Shells might burst with an appalling roar, and
smaller missiles whirr through the air; but so long
as none of them were struck he meant to keep
everlastingly at his job of taking the car through
the hurricane of iron.</p>
<p>The others, however, were allowed a chance to
turn their eyes from right to left as they sped on.
Consequently they saw some terrible things that
were spared the driver. Here a tree was riven of
its limbs as clean as though struck by lightning,
leaving the bare trunk standing there like a telegraph
pole. In another quarter a dreadful half-muffled
burst of sound held their attention; and
as they looked it was to see the whole section of
ground rise in the air, burst into fragments, and
then settle back again in a cloud of dust.</p>
<p>Bumpus hardly breathed, he was so thrilled by
all these astonishing things that attested to the
frightful power of the great shells hurled by the
German military monster machines miles and miles
away.</p>
<p>It seemed like a full hour to the stout boy before
the reeling car finally arrived at that envied turn in
the road, and yet instead of minutes seconds had
hardly elapsed.</p>
<p>Thad knew there was serious danger of a spill
if he attempted to make that swing around the
bend at the reckless pace he had struck. This necessitated
a holding up; and poor Bumpus, quick to notice
the alteration in their speed, quivered with a
new fear, really believing that something must have
happened to Thad, who was in danger of collapsing
at the wheel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>Indeed, Bumpus involuntarily half raised both
hands as though with the idea of catching the
chauffeur, and sustaining him; for it chanced that
he was directly behind the other at the time.</p>
<p>Then the car hit the curve and commenced to
swing around it. Bumpus was jammed up against
his seat-mate Giraffe, and came near crushing the
elongated scout, such was his bulk.</p>
<p>But they had passed safely around the coveted
turn, and were once more hurrying along the road,
the speed increasing with a jolt as Thad again gave
full power.</p>
<p>Now if they could manage to hold their good fortune
for just another half minute they stood a
chance of running out of the fire zone, where those
dropping shells were plowing up the ground, and
leaving gaping craters here, there and everywhere,
into each of which a good-sized cabin could be
hidden.</p>
<p>All of them began to live again, for during the
worst of the bombardment, doubtless, they had simply
existed, as Giraffe afterwards candidly admitted,
when speaking about the adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>It was soon only a horrible nightmare, a memory
that would haunt them as long as they lived. The
shells still continued to fall, and the terrific crashes
kept making a strange martial music that rendered
talking next to impossible; but all this was now
going on in their rear.</p>
<p>For some reason the Germans meant to make that
particular section of road impassable. Perhaps
they gave it much more prominence than it really
deserved, for the boys had discovered few signs of
any movement of troops or supplies along its whole
length.</p>
<p>Things began to brighten once they were beyond
that turmoil and confusion. Bumpus even had a
little color creep back into his cheeks, though he
still continued to quiver at times, and suck in his
breath with gasps. If Giraffe could read the signs
aright, when he turned to look at his chum several
times, the movement of Bumpus&rsquo; lips told that he
was saying his favorite word, &ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; again and
again. Well, it spoke volumes for the sense of awe
that had filled his whole soul during that period
of stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>Now they could begin to take notice once more of
what lay ahead. Of course, each boy was ardently
hoping they would have no more of that sort of
business to go through with. It was a bit too strenuous,
even Thad was ready to admit. Scouts were
not supposed to be the possessors of iron nerve; and
really that was what any one must have to pass
through such an experience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>A mile, two, three of them soon slipped away.
The racket had partly died down by this time, possibly
owing to the fact of their being further away
from the scene; and then again the German gunners
may have believed their object accomplished, so that
there was no further need of wasting shells in that
quarter.</p>
<p>Giraffe soon discovered a French battery. Then
he pointed out another partly concealed under some
sheltering branches of trees. They were firing steadily,
as if carrying out orders.</p>
<p>Further along he also located a host of men in
the French blue advancing at the double-quick over
open ground. The sight was inspiring to the boys,
for they could easily understand that owing to a
shift in the battle the commander-in-chief must be
transferring one of his army corps, with the idea
of striking the invaders in the flank and hurling
them back in confusion. When those Frenchmen
do move it is with a rapidity that fairly dazzles their
opponents; and their blows are delivered with all the
enthusiasm that formerly used to delight the observing
eye of the Great Napoleon himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be getting near Headquarters by now,
don&rsquo;t you think, Thad?&rdquo; shouted Giraffe presently;
for the car was making so much noise, together with
other things near and far, that of course it was difficult
to talk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;I expect so,&rdquo; the other simply replied, not even
turning his head while speaking, lest he lose his grip
on the middle of the road; and considering the speed
at which they were going just then such a thing
might spell disaster.</p>
<p>Indeed, there were also other signs to indicate
this fact. The region was very retired, but twice
now they had seen a whizzing motorcycle passing
along; and somehow they guessed that the man
crouching in the saddle must be carrying important
orders for some part of the line near by.</p>
<p>Another thing had caught that keen eye of Giraffe,
which he hastened to make known to his
comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! notice the telephone wire alongside the
road, will you?&rdquo; he yelled; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a military line to
boot, I can tell that by the way it&rsquo;s strung. The
French Signal Corps has put it up on the run. Yes,
and you see, General Joffre from his Headquarters
can even give his orders to some of the nearest
corps commanders, at the same time learning how
the battle is going along their front! Wow! what
wouldn&rsquo;t I give to be able to break in and hear what
was being said right now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dream of trying it, Giraffe!&rdquo; shrilled
Bumpus, galvanized into a sudden state of horror
at the very idea; &ldquo;why, they&rsquo;d burn you alive if
you dared interfere with such a thing as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t worry, old fellow,&rdquo; Giraffe immediately
assured him; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t <i>quite</i> lost my head yet.
I&rsquo;m not such a fool as I look!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a comfort,&rdquo; Bumpus told him; and
really the tall scout never wholly knew whether
that was said in satire or not.</p>
<p>At any minute now Thad expected to be halted
by a vidette post, for of course the immediate vicinity
of Headquarters would be heavily guarded to
secure the safety of the commanding genius to
whom the French armies must look for guidance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slow up a bit, Thad,&rdquo; suddenly cried Giraffe,
poking the driver in the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo; demanded Bumpus, at once
alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are men waiting for us at that point ahead
where the trees overhang the road; because I
glimpsed the glint of gun-barrels in the sun. And
we don&rsquo;t want to be asked to explain who we are
after they&rsquo;ve made sieves out of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the car&rsquo;s pace was cut down to a point where
they could stop instantly if the order came. Nor
were they kept in suspense long, for as they drew
near the spot indicated by &ldquo;Old Eagle Eye&rdquo; three
soldiers suddenly appeared in view and made peremptory
motions with the guns they carried.</p>
<p>Thad came to a stand beside them. He instantly
recognized that one of the men in blue was a sergeant,
from the marks on his sleeves, and to him
the young driver spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have come with important dispatches for
General Joffre; they must be delivered into his
hands immediately!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>The man, a grizzled veteran, apparently could
not speak English. He was observing the quartette
of scouts in evident bewilderment. Their faded
khaki uniforms no doubt puzzled him greatly;
though doubtless in his mind they were immediately
associated with General French&rsquo;s British
army, some members of which he may have seen.</p>
<p>But there was one thing he did understand, and
that was the mention of the name of &ldquo;Joffre.&rdquo; Accompanied
by those commanding gestures, and that
serious expression on the face of the determined-looking
young fellow it stood for something highly
important.</p>
<p>He spoke a few words to one of the privates who
immediately hurried away. Thad realized that this
probably meant some one would be summoned who
could speak the language, and learn what they
wanted.</p>
<p>A minute, two of them passed. The boys moved
restlessly. It seemed as though too much precious
time might be slipping by. After the grand rush
that had carried them safely through so many perils,
to be held up like this at the very last was annoying,
to say the least of it.</p>
<p>But the agony ended finally. They discovered
a couple of hastening figures, one of which could
be recognized as the private who had gone away;
while the other seemed to be an officer of some
rank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you young fellows, and what do you
want here, where no one is allowed to come?&rdquo; the
latter demanded, half angrily as he came up.</p>
<p>Thad guessed that the French officer must believe
them to be newspaper correspondents, rashly
thrusting themselves into dangerous places in an
eager desire for fresh news to send over to London,
or American papers.</p>
<p>He had it all mapped out, and meant to explain in
as few words as possible so as to save time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are American boys, M&rsquo;sieu,&rdquo; he started in
with, &ldquo;who by accident were caught between the
lines in this battle. We found a chance to assist
the Red Cross Corps at a field hospital. One of our
number even drove an ambulance all the way to
Paris with a load of wounded. There was an
American surgeon who did wonders for your brave
men. One was brought in terribly battered. It
turned out that he had been on a motorcycle bearing
important messages for General Joffre when he
ran into a van, and had his machine crushed. He
may die from his hurts; but the thing that grieved
him most was the fact that his dispatches were being
held up. There did not seem to be any one else
to intrust them with, and so the American surgeon
handed them over to us. We have come through
shot and shell to deliver the same to General Joffre;
and please, M&rsquo;sieu, get them in his hands in a
hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">THE MAN WHO SAVED PARIS</span></h2>
<p>The officer stared, as well he might. It was a
most unprecedented thing, and almost unbelievable,
that important dispatches should have been given
into the hands of a party of mere American boys
who happened to be wearing the uniforms of Scouts,
to be delivered, while there was yet a Frenchman
alive to volunteer for the duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me this is true, and that
you have carried these precious papers all the way
here to Headquarters?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>For answer Thad drew forth the packet, and held
it out to the officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is, just as the messenger gave it into
our possession,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the car?&rdquo; continued the other, even as his
fingers closed upon the packet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A patriotic French gentleman who was already
using it in the service of France donated it willingly
for the purpose when he learned of the great
need,&rdquo; Thad went on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you have been under fire too, I should say,
for I can see where the body of the car has been
torn by something like a bursting shell!&rdquo; cried the
other, as he allowed his admiring glance to rest
once more on the resolute face of the boy at the
wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are unharmed, and you have the dispatches,
M&rsquo;sieu!&rdquo; returned Thad, significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait here until I return!&rdquo; snapped the officer,
with which he turned and went off on a run.</p>
<p>The agony was over. Bumpus could smile again
now, and gradually get his customary high color
back. So they continued to sit there and wait. It
seemed very calm and delightful around them, for
they were really at some distance from the fighting
line. How strange it seemed that the commander-in-chief
should be so far removed from the front,
with all its dreadful noise and confusion. Here,
surrounded by his maps, he could pace up and down
in the little humble building where he had taken
up his station, keep his finger on the pulse of the
whole extended front, know accurately just how
things were going, send hurry calls to this general
or that, make any necessary changes in arrangements
to offset some move on the part of the foe;
and in fact manipulate the movements of half a
million men as though he sat at a chess board with
a comrade, under the soft rays of the evening lamp,
to play a mock battle with bits of dumb ivory instead
of living, breathing, suffering human beings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>To Thad in particular it was most wonderful,
the quiet and repose of this thing; and he knew
how it marked a vast change in the order of events
since those days of our own Civil War, when a
general sat upon his horse, as did Grant at many a
battle, smoking his cigar, watching the play of
events through his glass, receiving constant reports
brought by couriers on horseback and personally directing
the arrangements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nowadays,&rdquo; remarked Giraffe, also mindful of
the great change that had taken place, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the field
telephone that takes the place of the wigwag work;
while sky scouts in aeroplanes observe all that is
going on below, to send messages to the gunners just
how to direct their fire. But here comes our friend
the colonel back to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he seems to be smiling pleasantly too,&rdquo; observed
the gratified Bumpus, to whom that fact implied
a great deal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave your car at one side of the road here,&rdquo;
said the officer as he arrived alongside. &ldquo;It will be
safe in the charge of these men, to whom I shall
give an order to that effect. General Joffre has
asked me to fetch you to him. He is interested
especially because you are Americans, and also only
boys. He wished me to tell you that he will gladly
shake hands with you, though his time is too precious
to grant you more than a minute just now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that is a great honor!&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe,
immediately leaping over the side of the car in his
haste to alight.</p>
<p>Thad lost no time in carrying out the instructions
given him. He moved the car further to one
side, so that it might not obstruct the road. They
hoped to be able to continue their journey all the
way to Paris in that same car; but should it be
needed in a military sense for other purposes, why,
some other means must be employed for gaining
their ends.</p>
<p>With the officer they walked along, and presently
came in sight of the building which the commander-in-chief
of all the French forces was using as his
Headquarters.</p>
<p>There was plenty of bustle outside the house.
Men came and went. Some of them it appeared
were mounted on horses that looked lathered with
sweat as though they had been whipped and spurred
to do their utmost in covering the ground between
some front and the place where the stout man held
forth whose genius was directing every move of
importance made by the French along that great
battle line. Others used the more modern method
of covering distances as rapidly as possible, and
had motorcycles that started off with a rattle like
a machine gun at work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>More or less awed by the fact that they were
about to be ushered into the presence of General
Joffre himself, the boys fell in behind the officer.
So they passed the guard at the door, who closely
scrutinized them; but the gesture made by their
conductor vouched for their conduct, and they were
not stopped.</p>
<p>Once inside and they saw the French commander-in-chief.
Bumpus was greatly surprised. Could
that stout man with the French military cap on
his head, and wearing a white mustache, and who
even seemed so genial as he turned to look toward
them, be the great man upon whom all bleeding
France now leaned in her time of need?</p>
<p>But Thad, more accustomed to reading character,
saw in the firm face and the keen eyes a wonderful
tactician, to whom the manipulation of armies was
second nature.</p>
<p>Then they came to where an extended hand
greeted them. General Joffre smiled at Thad as he
squeezed the boy&rsquo;s fingers heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am interested in your adventure, my brave
American boys,&rdquo; he said to them. &ldquo;Some other
time perhaps I would like to hear about it in full.
You will pardon me if I cut the interview short.
France is deeply indebted to you for your noble assistance.
I thank you from my heart in the name
of my country.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>He shook hands with each scout in turn. Then
the colonel managed to draw them away again,
knowing that other dusty messengers were coming
all the while, bringing still fresher news concerning
later developments of the fighting; and that even
seconds were worth everything to this overworked
man in the flat-crowned military cap, who consulted
the colored maps on the walls, talked with this man
and that, gave orders that were instantly written
down, and through it all seemed to be as calm as
a storekeeper selling a bill of goods to a customer.</p>
<p>Stepping back out of the way, they were allowed
to remain there for a few minutes just to observe
how the weighty matter of directing a dozen armies
could be managed through one chief brain. It was
an experience that few others could ever say they
had passed through. Dozens of those talented and
&ldquo;nervy&rdquo; newspaper correspondents would have given
all they possessed for the privilege of being in that
house for just ten minutes or so; it would make
them famous for life. But money could not purchase
such a favor; influence never gained it; and
only personal service at the risk of their lives had
allowed Thad and his three chums the inestimable
privilege of shaking hands with General Joffre in
the midst of his work.</p>
<p>Presently, when he thought they had stayed long
enough to be fully compensated for all they had endured,
the officer whispered to Thad that it was time
they retired. So he led the way outside the
house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>Of course all of the boys expected that he would
now tell them they were at liberty to enter the
car and go their way. Thad indeed had it in his
mind to ask how best they had better depart; for
if it could be avoided he certainly did not want to
pass through that battered section of the road again.
Even though the bombardment had ceased, the condition
of the roadbed must be such that travel could
hardly be a delight.</p>
<p>To the surprise of Thad, and the delight of voracious
Giraffe, who it seemed could never get his
fill of such things as watching the developments of
a battle, the officer made them a proposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Joffre would do some little thing to
show how he appreciates what you have accomplished
this day, young Messieurs,&rdquo; he started to
say; &ldquo;and in the belief that perhaps you might like
to see through glasses what a battle of today looks
like he has bidden me conduct you to a point of
observation near by, where we are watching the ebb
and flow of the fighting. Would it please you to
accept?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course Giraffe was the first to give an affirmative
answer, though Allan came along close on his
heels; and Thad also added his voice in favor of
the proposal. No one noticed that Bumpus fell
silent. There was a great struggle going on in the
mind of the stout boy. He had as much curiosity
as the next one; but those terrible happenings
seemed to almost freeze the blood in his veins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>He plucked at Thad&rsquo;s coat sleeve, and the other
turning found that Bumpus had a look of genuine
pain on his again whitened face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I just couldn&rsquo;t stand it all over again,
Thad,&rdquo; he commenced saying; &ldquo;somehow it affects
me down in the pit of my stomach, and I seem to
have a queer gone feeling I can&rsquo;t describe. Let me
stay here in the car, please, Thad; and don&rsquo;t think
me a miserable coward, will you, for backing out
this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad gripped his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I won&rsquo;t, Bumpus!&rdquo; he declared with vehemence;
&ldquo;I know better than to think that. You&rsquo;ve
seen enough of this awful thing. I don&rsquo;t blame you,
either, and I&rsquo;m in something of the same fix myself;
but Giraffe must see it through; and besides,
it is a terrible temptation, because we are looking
at history being made. Stay by the car then, Bumpus.
It shows your good sense, that&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he hurried off after the other, who had already
started. Bumpus looked as if he already half
repented of his decision; but shaking his head sadly
he turned his back upon his chums so that he might
not be tempted beyond his power of resistance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the officer had stepped back into the
house and soon reappeared bearing several field-glass
cases swung over his shoulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;These are for the young friends of General
Joffre to use,&rdquo; he told the delighted boys as he
again joined the trio; &ldquo;he gave them into my hands
himself, and said that to me. Now we will make
our way over to the hill from which observations
are being constantly taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe being a scout who always kept his eyes
about him observed several things that might have
escaped the notice of Bumpus, for instance. He saw
that as far as possible it was managed so that even
an air scout sailing over in his Taube aeroplane,
and with glasses to assist him, might not learn where
French Headquarters was located. This was of
course done in order to prevent the possibility of a
sudden raid on the part of some Uhlan regiment
that had managed to break through the French lines;
or even the dropping of bombs from a passing airship,
with the hope of depriving the defenders of
Paris of the services of the commander-in-chief.</p>
<p>A wire was cunningly laid along the road from
tree to tree, but always in such a fashion that it
could not be discovered from aloft. Even the
couriers who came and went tried to conceal themselves
as much as possible, in order to deceive the
foe, to whom these signs might betray the truth.</p>
<p>Soon they arrived at the hill which evidently was
being used for an observation post. Climbing this
at the heels of the officer, the three scouts presently
found themselves on the crest, where a scene
was spread before them well worthy of being written
on the tablets of their memories as long as they
lived.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">WHERE VICTORY WAS SEIZED</span></h2>
<p>More than half a dozen men in military uniforms
could be seen, each one with a pair of binoculars
in his hands, and most of them sweeping the
horizon in their intense eagerness to watch how
the fortunes of the battle ebbed and flowed. Now
it might be one of them would point a quivering
finger toward some particular spot where he had
detected events of a thrilling nature developing.
Then they would compare, notes, and perhaps send
a messenger hurriedly to inform the commander-in-chief
of what was going on.</p>
<p>The boys lost little time in making use of the
field glasses that had been placed in their hands.
It was a picture worth seeing, as they followed
along up and down the ridges where those billowing
clouds of smoke told of action.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>They picked out many batteries of friend and foe
from these signs; they could watch the movements
of heavy bodies of moving troops as they were
flung forward at some supposed weak place in the
French lines; and then observe the shock when
machine-guns opened upon them, so that the companies
dwindled away to mere squads, and these in
turn to individuals drifting back in an uncertain
way to where they had started forth so bravely.</p>
<p>Again they felt all the thrill that goes with a
battle. No doubt, too, they experienced something
of the horror also; for it was not their country that
was being trodden under the iron heel of the oppressor,
nor their capital in danger of being captured
again, as back in &lsquo;71.</p>
<p>After taking a steady look along the whole front,
as seen from that hill top, the boys rested their
eyes. Their friend the colonel was conversing with
some of his fellow officers; Thad even suspected
that he might be telling them of the exploit carried
through by the boys in faded khaki, whose presence
there at such a crisis must naturally have
aroused the wonder of the Frenchmen; for several
times he saw the latter look their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! where&rsquo;s Bumpus now?&rdquo; suddenly demanded
Allan, showing that in all the excitement he
had not missed the stout chum until then, but supposed
the other must be only hanging behind, as
usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope now he hasn&rsquo;t got lost as he did the other
night, though I don&rsquo;t see how he could, coming only
that short distance, and in broad daylight too.
Thad, what&rsquo;s the answer?&rdquo; and Giraffe turned on
the patrol leader as he demanded this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the poor fellow just got cold feet, that&rsquo;s
the truth of the matter,&rdquo; was the way Thad explained
it. &ldquo;You know he isn&rsquo;t built on the same
lines as you happen to be, Giraffe. Bumpus has
seen about all the fighting he can stand. And between
us I give him credit for staying back by the
car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, I&rsquo;m not so crazy as to want to see much
more myself,&rdquo; admitted the tall scout. &ldquo;It cuts
me to the bone to see such terrible things; but stop,
and just think how proud we&rsquo;ll all be some day to
be able to declare we watched this wonderful battle
that&rsquo;s going down in history as one of the greatest
ever known. It means a whole lot to get up
and say, &lsquo;yes, that&rsquo;s right, because I was there, and
saw it with my own eyes!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of the officers seem to be watching one particular
place now,&rdquo; advised Thad; &ldquo;and we&rsquo;d better
follow suit. They act as if they thought some
vital stroke might be on the carpet over there on
the left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly all of the boys leveled their glasses
again. It was easy to tell which way to look, because
they could figure that out by a glance at the
Frenchmen. No one was talking just then, but
every officer had his eye intently glued to his binoculars.
And no sooner did Thad focus upon the distant
ground than he saw why those men were in
such a state of suspense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>The Germans were making possibly the most savage
assault of the whole day. They had issued forth
from cover, and were crossing the open ground in
dense masses. It was simply amazing to see how
splendidly those ranks kept their formation even
after all manner of machine-guns, and those of
larger bore, opened a hailstorm of lead and iron.</p>
<p>If men went down, as they undoubtedly must
have done here, there and everywhere, like leaves
falling from the trees with the Autumn wind, the
slight gaps were not noticeable at that distance, for
others simply closed in, and the solid mass kept
charging on and on like a machine that, once set
in motion, could not be stopped by any power on
earth.</p>
<p>Away back of the first lines came a second and
still a third formation. These of course were the
reinforcements meant to take up the fight after those
in the lead had been so dreadfully thinned out that
they no longer made a force to be feared. Perhaps
there were even other masses still waiting to
follow, though those who came later would have to
pick their way over a field of fallen men.</p>
<p>If in this way they managed to break through
the French lines it might mean the beginning of the
end. That one point was likely to bring about a
decision in the great battle; for it would mean a reformation
of lines, with the initiative in the hands
of the Germans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>Thad could not blame those French officers for
watching with white lips what was taking place.
He understood what was at stake as well as they
could do. Nevertheless, the fact that his sympathy
lay with the French because they were the &ldquo;under
dog&rdquo; in the fight, did not prevent him from feeling
the greatest admiration for those stanch German
lines of men who kept moving along shoulder to
shoulder while their ranks were being so steadily
decimated by the machine-guns and batteries of
larger pieces.</p>
<p>Everything would depend on what happened in
the next few minutes. Thad could see that the
Frenchmen were intently watching the play of the
game, and that they must be anticipating some vital
move that would alter things in their favor.</p>
<p>Again he sealed his eyes to the end of his glasses.
Across the open those masses were still sweeping,
though the first lines were dreadfully thinned out by
now, and with good reason, if those dots upon the
green sward in their rear meant all that Thad believed
they did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>Suddenly one of the officers uttered a shriek. It
had a note of joy about it that told Thad something
had happened. Why, the shells were no longer
bursting in the midst of the front ranks now. As
if at a given signal to every battery at work, the
range had been raised and now a <i>barrage</i>, or curtain
of fire had been established between the first
and second lines of Germans. This was intended to
shut out the reinforcements completely, while the
machine guns cleaned up what was left of those
who could not retreat, and whose advance meant
simply walking into the arms of death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the Frenchies!&rdquo; exclaimed Giraffe, with
possibly a touch of boyish contempt in his voice;
for of course he could not understand what this
meant to those almost frantic men, any more than
he could appreciate their emotional dispositions.</p>
<p>Americans or British under similar conditions
would have shaken hands as they congratulated
each other over the successful outcome of the engagement
that meant so much for victory; Frenchmen
must embrace, and even kiss each other on the
cheek, an action that caused Giraffe to shake his
head in disgust, for it seemed so womanish to him.</p>
<p>Thad, listening, heard those men exchange congratulations
as though they truly believed that the
victory must be clinched; and that from then on
the German army would be forced to retreat toward
the north, where no doubt they already had a line
marked out along the River Aisne at which to make
a stand in case of disaster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>The next time he looked through his glasses Thad
was shocked to observe that the masses of German
troops had dwindled to a mere handful. These men
still struggled blindly, obedient to the call of duty
to push on; but they were like so many blind men
staggering amidst the wreckage of the regiments of
fallen.</p>
<p>Strange to say, it was Giraffe who first let his
hand holding the glasses fall at his side. The roar
was so great even at that distance he could not be
heard when he spoke, though he raised his voice to
a shout. But Thad, reading the movement of the
other&rsquo;s lips, could guess the import of the words;
and he set them down as being:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve had enough, I guess; let&rsquo;s get away
from here, boys. Seems like the rest of the Kaiser&rsquo;s
army has fallen back, unable to face that curtain of
fire. It is France&rsquo;s big day, and that goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, later on, when the whole truth came out, it
was learned that despairing France, almost at the
last gasp, took on a new lease of life in that hour
when the most violent assault of the enemy failed
to pierce her lines, and the German army was hurled
back along the Marne. Joffre had discounted the
tactics of the best of the Kaiser&rsquo;s great generals; and
his sun was steadily heading toward the zenith.
There was no Bismarck, no Von Moltke there to
guide the destinies of the invading host; and France
had consequently won a most important victory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>Neither of the others thought to say a single word
calculated to cause Giraffe to alter his mind. Truth
to tell, both Thad and Allan were heartily sick of
looking upon such terrible sights, and would only
too gladly shut them out of their minds for the time
being, if it could only be managed. They knew
full well they were bound to be haunted by much
of what had fallen to their observation during those
blood-stirring days and nights spent so close to the
battle lines in France.</p>
<p>So only waiting to catch the eye of their friend,
the colonel, Thad beckoned to him. The officer hurried
to join them. His face shone with such deep
satisfaction as could only spring from seeing some
cherished object accomplished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We win the fight, my brave boys!&rdquo; he told them
joyously as he went around to shake hands with
each one in turn; and Giraffe half drew back as
though a little afraid lest the effusive Frenchman
might feel tempted to clasp him around the neck,
and actually kiss him on the cheek.</p>
<p>However, they were spared that exhibition of
French emotion, for which Giraffe at least must
have been vastly pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you believe the Germans will give it up
after this, do you, M&rsquo;sieu?&rdquo; asked Thad, wishing
to make sure they had gauged things correctly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was their last and most powerful stroke,&rdquo;
they were proudly told. &ldquo;But they could not brush
aside our valiant army, standing to their guns, and
cutting great swathes through the padded lines. Already
we know the order has gone out for a general
retreat. After this it can only be a series of rear-guard
actions, for they will try to hold us in check
as long as possible, so that trenches may be completed
in the north of France, where the defeated
army expects to make a stand. But France has
been born again this day, and never again shall
the foot of a German foe be set in the streets of
our beloved Paris. It has been written over there
where you saw what happened. What more can I
do for you, my young friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have seen enough and to spare, M&rsquo;sieu,&rdquo; said
Thad, smilingly. &ldquo;We rejoice with you that the
victory is won, and your capital saved; but these
are no scenes for boys to feast their eyes on. So
we had better go our way, and try to find in Paris
the mother of our chum, where we expect she is
waiting for our coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I applaud your sentiments, young M&rsquo;sieu,&rdquo; said
the officer, gravely. &ldquo;I have a boy of about your
age at my home near the Mediterranean, where with
his mother he lives at peace. Not for anything
would I wish him here, to have his young soul harrowed
by these terrible sights and sounds. It is
bad enough for old campaigners like myself, who
have seen service in Algiers. We have already sent
the great news to our commander, whose heart will
sing with joy, for he must know France has been
saved this day. And now I myself will accompany
you to where you left your comrade and your car,
that I may say farewell to you as you go from us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">HEADED FOR PARIS</span></h2>
<p>Somehow or other Thad felt strangely drawn
toward the French colonel who had been so kind to
them. Perhaps the fact that he had just told them
of his own son had something to do with it. At any
rate, it seemed that the soldier entertained a sincere
affection for boys, thus telling that his own heart
was still young.</p>
<p>As he walked at the other&rsquo;s side an idea came
to Thad, who evidently believed in the old adage,
&ldquo;strike while the iron is hot,&rdquo; for it was a favor he
wished to ask, and one that might prove of considerable
advantage to them later on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it be possible for you to give us some
idea concerning the roads around Paris, M&rsquo;sieu?&rdquo;
he asked, in that persuasive tone of his.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing would please me better,&rdquo; came the quick
reply. &ldquo;I understand why you make the request.
Yes, it would be easily possible for a stranger to
lose his way, and wander far out of his course.
Stay, I can do better than that. Even now I remember
that I have a small road map in my possession,
such as will give you all the information you
require.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He soon put the article mentioned in Thad&rsquo;s possession,
and proceeded to show him several courses,
which, if followed religiously, would land them
safely in the great French capital.</p>
<p>Giraffe was deeply interested. As a scout he had
always shown considerable ability with regard to
negotiating strange paths. Then, besides, it must
not be forgotten that Giraffe was the only one of
the four who had already been to Paris.</p>
<p>He scanned that little map, and listened closely
to all the officer said. Doubtless Giraffe, with his
woodcraft education in mind, was fixing the details
of that road chart in his mind, so that on occasion
he could recall it almost as plainly as print.
This is always possible when one has learned to
remember details, a feature of scout education.</p>
<p>Later on Giraffe meant to have something to say
about that same chart; but for the present he contented
himself with listening, and taking it all in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;Another thought comes to me,&rdquo; observed the
colonel, about the time they drew near the spot
where their car stood, with Bumpus occupying the
whole rear seat, upon which he was sprawled in
perfect contentment. &ldquo;You may meet with trouble
on the way. Some officious patriot might even
think of taking your car from you, always in the
interest of France, which just now is in sore need
of every such conveyance. I can arrange it so
that you will avoid all such inconvenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And depend on it, M&rsquo;sieu,&rdquo; Thad assured him,
&ldquo;we do mean to turn the car over to the military
authorities just as soon as we have reached the city.
That was a part of our agreement when we accepted
the loan of it from the owner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait for me, then,&rdquo; he was told.</p>
<p>They saw him vanish within the small house
where General Joffre held forth, with the whole
extended battle line in his single grip. One minute,
two passed; then their friend reappeared again.
He was smiling encouragingly, as though his mission
had not been in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! he&rsquo;s got a paper of some kind in his
hand!&rdquo; exclaimed the observant Giraffe. &ldquo;Now, I
bet you it&rsquo;s a pass that&rsquo;ll give us the right of way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, Giraffe had guessed truly, for that was exactly
what it turned out to be, a brief pass in French,
and bearing the magical name of General Joffre
himself in the bargain. No wonder Thad received
it with more or less delight, while Bumpus and Giraffe
and Allan surveyed that signature with awe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;General Joffre was only too pleased to sign the
pass I wrote and presented to him,&rdquo; announced the
officer, proudly. &ldquo;He said it was a small thing to
do for such brave boys who had shown their sympathy
for the great cause. You should have no
trouble in getting to Paris. In a way, I wish I
could go with you, for it would take me nearer my
dear ones; but there is a stern duty that holds me
here. Some day, when we have really saved France,
and driven the enemy from her border, I may be allowed
to see them again. And now adieu, my young
friends. Heaven preserve you, and take you all
safely back to your own country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and left them hastily after shaking
hands. Thad thought there were signs of emotion
on the soldier&rsquo;s face, which he did not wish
them to see. Undoubtedly he had his own fine
boy in mind much while in the company of these
intrepid American lads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get aboard, the rest of you!&rdquo; urged the impatient
Bumpus, making room for Giraffe alongside
him on the rear seat; but they could excuse his
eagerness to be off, remembering that he yearned
to see his invalid mother again.</p>
<p>Giraffe gave a last look toward the small house
that would go down in history as a famous place,
since between those four plain walls had been
planned all the wonderful moves that had given
the French the victory of the Marne. In days to
come that spot would ever be a holy shrine to
which untold thousands of patriotic citizens would
journey, to feast their eyes on the &ldquo;Headquarters
of Joffre.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I&rsquo;m away off my guess,&rdquo; said Giraffe,
wagging that long head of his in a wise fashion,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s bound to be a shift of base here pretty
soon. I can see signs of it right now. And why
not, when the scene is going to change, with the
whole German army in full retreat to the north?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! <i>please</i> tumble in here, Giraffe, like a good
fellow,&rdquo; pleaded Bumpus, who of old knew how
fond the other was of talking, once he got upon a
subject like that; &ldquo;you can buzz me all you want,
while we&rsquo;re on the move. I don&rsquo;t see how I&rsquo;m going
to stand the delay much longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe did not make any reply, but climbed
aboard and settled himself in what space the stout
chum could afford to give him. He and Bumpus
always managed pretty well, for as Giraffe was
fond of saying jokingly, they were like a choice
strip of breakfast bacon, since they represented the
&ldquo;fat and the lean of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Thad had started, and Giraffe must needs
squirm around so as to catch one last look at the
wonderful picture, which he wished to impress upon
his mind &ldquo;for keeps,&rdquo; as he put it.</p>
<p>Of course they did not expect to return over the
same road they had taken when heading for the
place. While the bombardment had long ago ceased,
at the same time the condition of the road might
be very bad in places. Besides, there was no necessity
for doing this, since their friend the colonel had
marked out another course for them to pursue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>Giraffe got busy almost as soon as they had covered
the first half mile. Leaning forward, he asked
Thad for the little road map which the officer had
given him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you why I want to look at the same
again,&rdquo; Giraffe went on to say, as he took it from
Thad. &ldquo;Seemed to me there was a cross-road that
would take us over to that main line where I met
you. And, you see, Thad, I&rsquo;m familiar with that
same, having navigated it twice. If we could make
it handy to strike over there I&rsquo;d like to act as guide
to the expedition, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Figure it out for yourself, Giraffe,&rdquo; Thad told
him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to do it, if we think the road
looks good to us. One way is as easy as another, so
long as we keep our heads about us and don&rsquo;t go
astray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I surely hope now nothing like that does
come along,&rdquo; sighed Bumpus; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of
getting lost, for this trip, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Giraffe told him, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll get there
O. K., you can depend on that. We haven&rsquo;t many
more miles to go before we strike the outskirts of
Paris, for the Germans got almost within big gunshot
of the place, you know, before they were forced
to swing around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>&ldquo;I understand that, Giraffe,&rdquo; said Bumpus, &ldquo;but
all the same I haven&rsquo;t forgotten how it&rsquo;s always
the very last lap that&rsquo;s the hardest to cover. All
sorts of things go wrong when you&rsquo;re in sight of
the goal. I never yet tried to do a series of things
but what it seemed like the very last was harder to
get through with than most of the others combined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thad understood what he meant, for he too had
often noticed the same thing; but nevertheless Thad
was not one of the kind to allow discouragement to
get the upper hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little more patience, Bumpus, and you&rsquo;ll be
there,&rdquo; he told the anxious one. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on the
way now, and no small troubles will be allowed to
hold us up long, if we can prevent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three minutes after Thad said this they heard
a sharp report. Bumpus of course jumped to the
conclusion that they were being made a target for
German shrapnel again; but Giraffe rested under
no such delusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes a tire, as sure as anything!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! what rotten luck!&rdquo; cried Bumpus dismally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to try everything once,&rdquo; Allan called
out, cheerily, for his nature was one that could not
be easily discouraged.</p>
<p>Thad hastened to draw up. An examination
showed them that one of the rear tires had been
punctured. While this might cause them a little
delay, it was not so bad as it might have been.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately we&rsquo;ve got an extra inner tube
along,&rdquo; announced Giraffe. &ldquo;Bumpus in prowling
around while we were up on that hill watching
the battle came across it. So now let&rsquo;s get busy,
and fix her up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little experience along such lines had made the
boys fairly proficient mechanicians. Thad went
about things in a business-like fashion; while even
Bumpus fluttered around, and offered to do anything
they told him, such was his eagerness to hasten
repairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, crawl under, and hold up the car while we
work,&rdquo; suggested Giraffe, maliciously; &ldquo;because I&rsquo;m
a little afraid of that jack we&rsquo;ve got; it doesn&rsquo;t
look overly strong. What&rsquo;s the use of having a
broad back like yours, Bumpus, if you can&rsquo;t make
good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Bumpus declined to be tempted to undertake
the job. He did cease his complaining remarks,
and went to one side of the road, where
he sat down and waited for the others to get
through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>They did not have the road to themselves all this
time. Occasionally some vehicle would come along.
Now it was a van loaded for the front, either with
goods, or soldiers, or ammunition. Again it might
turn out to be some of the wounded heroes on their
way to the rear. Several times the boys had seen
men in uniform, with perhaps an arm bound up,
walking along the road. They had stoutly declined
to take up precious room in an ambulance, meaning
to walk all the way to the city. That was the kind
of stuff those French fighters were made of. Being
sent to the rear meant to them a punishment they
did not much fancy, while the battle was still on,
and enemies to be struck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right again!&rdquo; announced Thad, finally, at
which Bumpus was galvanized into life, for he
scrambled to his feet, and ambled toward them, his
face creased with amiable smiles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all we made pretty fine time of it!&rdquo; declared
Allan; &ldquo;just twenty minutes, and a hard job
in the bargain, because we&rsquo;re not familiar with the
French style of tires and inner tubes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more they were moving along, and all
seemed well. Giraffe even made ready to keep an
eye out for that cross-road which Thad had promised
to explore in the endeavor to reach the main
line into the city. He guessed that it must be somewhere
ahead a short distance; any minute they
might come upon the turn, when Thad expected to
decide on their next move. If the road looked good
they would try it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I see the turn, Thad,&rdquo; he presently called
out; &ldquo;just where that post is planted. Yes, it has
some sort of sign on the same. And now to decide
whether we want to try the run across, or not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
<br /><span class="small">GIRAFFE HAS A NARROW ESCAPE</span></h2>
<p>Thad had no hesitation about turning into the
side road. It seemed a pretty decent route and,
indeed, as he happened to know, there were few poor
roads anywhere in France.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a whole lot to learn about the way
to make decent roads,&rdquo; Giraffe admitted as they
started on. &ldquo;America can boast of some things
but in others she&rsquo;s away behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who cares, now that we&rsquo;re getting right along?&rdquo;
sang out Bumpus, apparently quite convinced that
their troubles were ended.</p>
<p>They had not gone half a mile when Thad showed
signs of uneasiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something bothers me about this engine, and
I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll have to stop and take a look at it,&rdquo;
he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exploded Bumpus, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad the walking
is good today, because I&rsquo;m commencing to believe
we&rsquo;ll have to come down to shank&rsquo;s mare before
we&rsquo;re through with this thing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>Allan and Thad were soon busily engaged in
looking over the motor. As it was in some ways
different from any with which the boys were familiar
they had to do considerable guessing as to
what caused the trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About how long will you be held here, Thad,
if you could make a guess?&rdquo; asked Giraffe. &ldquo;I
want to know, because to tell you the truth I&rsquo;ve got
a caved-in feeling right now, and nothing&rsquo;d please
me better than to pick up a bite for the crowd. We
passed a couple of small houses back there, and I
saw some women and old men working in the market
gardens. They all stopped work and stared at
us when we whizzed past; but then mebbe I could
coax the housewives to hand over some grub if I
shoved a few francs before them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! well, we may be here all of fifteen minutes,&rdquo;
said Thad, without looking up from his work.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay longer than that, Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck to you, old sport,&rdquo; called out Bumpus,
who had remained in his seat this time; &ldquo;and
say, remember we&rsquo;re your chums, three of us, all
told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe trotted off. The others kept busily at
work, and Thad presently announced that he believed
he had solved the riddle. It was a simple
thing that had gone wrong, which could be remedied
by the tightening of a bolt. This he proved
to the complete satisfaction of Allan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now if only Giraffe hadn&rsquo;t let that appetite of
his get the better of him, we could get away in a
hurry!&rdquo; suggested Bumpus, loftily, as though such
a thing as getting hungry might be accounted a capital
crime on certain occasions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark! what&rsquo;s all that row back there?&rdquo; exclaimed
Thad, just then.</p>
<p>A pretty lively chorus of shouts had broken out.
This gave the boys a feeling of uneasiness, because
their comrade had vanished in that quarter only a
few minutes before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s around the bend, Thad!&rdquo; cried Bumpus,
standing up on the seat the better to see; &ldquo;and
they&rsquo;re coming this way too, in a big hurry! Oh!
my stars! just hear how they whoop it up, men,
women and children all shouting and shrieking.
Whatever could poor Giraffe have done to get them
so crazy mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; snapped Thad, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll soon
glimpse what&rsquo;s going on. There he is just around
the curve of the road, and running like a deer at
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he hasn&rsquo;t got a bit of grub with him,
either,&rdquo; added Bumpus, quick to discover this fact.
&ldquo;See him gallop, will you? Giraffe can cover the
ground like a rabbit, once he starts out to try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s got good reason for wanting to hit
the pace up this time, it seems,&rdquo; Allan hastened to
remark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>They all realized that he spoke the truth, for just
then in the rear of the wildly fleeing Giraffe appeared
a band of natives in full chase. There were
a couple of pretty agile old men in blue blouses,
and wooden sabots that clattered as they came on
at headlong speed. Then there were at least five
women, furiously angry in the bargain, for they
waved their hands, and shrieked all sorts of things,
in French, of course, so the boys failed to grasp
their meaning. Besides, a number of partly-grown
boys and girls tried to outstrip the older ones.</p>
<p>It was a small edition of a mob, such as the boys
had often seen portrayed on the screen at a motion
picture show. Giraffe evidently had no intention
of allowing them to overtake him, for he
was doing his prettiest to keep his lead.</p>
<p>Some of the pursuers waved hoes, while others
had clubs, or possibly another type of native garden
tool, showing that they had been at work in the
fields when this sudden fit of anger seized hold of
them.</p>
<p>Thad hastened to get the engine started. Had
that failed just at this critical time it must have
gone hard with them, for those peasants would not
listen to reason.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>Then he and Allan took their places. All was
ready for the arrival of Giraffe, who as he ran was
trying to shout something to them. It must have
been sweet music in his ears to catch the sound of
the motor working, and realize that an avenue of
escape was opened up to him; for Giraffe could not
have had much liking for all those hoes and sickles
and clubs.</p>
<p>His long legs got him over the ground in ample
time. As he arrived at the side of the car Giraffe
stopped and shook his fist toward the oncoming mob,
which action caused another outburst of frantic
shrieking.</p>
<p>Bumpus leaned over, and gripping the attenuated
scout, actually dragged him a board. Safety
first was one of the stout boy&rsquo;s favorite mottoes;
and with all those angry natives on the run in their
direction he did not believe in taking unnecessary
chances.</p>
<p>As the car started off with a rush Allan looking
back saw the mob waving their various weapons
menacingly. They seemed very much disappointed
because of missing a chance to beat Giraffe up; but
that worthy, standing in the car, continued to make
derisive gestures at them as long as they were in
sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But whatever did you do to them, to get their
dander up so bad, Giraffe?&rdquo; asked Bumpus, after
the other had calmed down enough to resume his
seat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; snapped the tall scout, vigorously.
&ldquo;I waved to &rsquo;em as I drew near the houses. They
seemed to be clustered in a bunch as if they&rsquo;d been
talking over something. Then one woman pointed
at me, and say, if the whole pack didn&rsquo;t make a
break in my direction. Well, I thought at first
I&rsquo;d stand and try to explain; but when I saw those
curved sickles and those big hoes swinging through
the air, and heard how they whooped it up, why, I
guessed it&rsquo;d be a heap healthier for a fellow of my
size in a different atmosphere. So I ran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say you did,&rdquo; Bumpus told him, admiringly;
&ldquo;why, Giraffe, you just <i>flew</i>, that&rsquo;s what you
did. I warrant you only hit the high places right
along. But what do you suppose they had against
you to make &rsquo;em act like wild hyenas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giraffe was not the fellow to try and hide behind
excuses when he had made a mess of things.
In this case, however, he expressed himself most
emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I never did a single thing to that bunch
of crazy people!&rdquo; he went on to say loudly, so that
the others could all hear him. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t a chance
to, for you see they started at me before I got
close enough to speak. I was just waving my hand
to &rsquo;em, social-like, when one woman gave a screech,
and then they commenced to make Rome howl.
Wow! they&rsquo;re certainly a queer lot, these French
peasants. I&rsquo;d like to know what there is about
my looks to make &rsquo;em so hopping mad. I knew I
was homely, like Abe Lincoln, but I didn&rsquo;t think
it&rsquo;d get me into such a peck of trouble as all that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;There must have been a reason for it,&rdquo; said
Thad over his shoulder; &ldquo;though we may never find
it out. Those people are as a rule friendly to strangers,
and willing to accommodate. Something queer
has happened to upset them, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll never be happy till I learn what it
was,&rdquo; asserted the aggrieved Giraffe, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;d been
one of the Greeks they tell you to beware of, bearing
gifts, they couldn&rsquo;t have acted worse. Yes,
there must have been a reason. And what hurts
me worst of all is that I&rsquo;m still as hungry as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They continued to speculate with regard to the
strange thing that had happened, but none of them
could hit upon any plausible cause. Later on they
happened to hear something that gave Giraffe a
clue upon which he worked assiduously.</p>
<p>Many wild stories were in circulation at that time
when the German armies were threatening Paris
again. One of the most extravagant of these was
to the effect that some monster German airships
had set out for the French capital, intending to
drop bombs, and create a reign of terror back of
the French lines, so as to cause Joffre to give way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>It may have been that some gossipy neighbor had
just been telling them a wonderful story about
certain daring vandals who had been lowered from
these gigantic Teuton dirigibles, with orders to
terrorize the whole country by starting fires and
creating a panic. Just then they saw Giraffe running
toward them, waving his arms in a strange
way. It was like setting a match to a train of
powder. They saw in this stranger one of the hated
and feared German monsters of whom mothers had
been talking for many years when children had to
be subdued. And inspired by a mad desire to capture
or destroy the stranger, who had evidently left
the car, and run back so as to set fire to their
houses, they had started toward Giraffe with all
that hostile outbreak.</p>
<p>It seemed a rather &ldquo;fishy&rdquo; explanation taken in
all, even Giraffe was bound to admit; and yet not
altogether impossible. In those black days when
the invaders were rushing toward Paris many
stories just as improbable found ready listeners, and
were fully believed by the credulous peasants.</p>
<p>They were all pleased when they could no longer
catch that angry chorus of cries and hoots. As
for Giraffe, he shuddered a little to contemplate
what might have happened had he ever allowed
those excited peasants to surround him, unable to
speak their language as he was. Going hungry
might be bad enough, but it was not a circumstance
to being man-handled by a mob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what next?&rdquo; Bumpus was saying. &ldquo;It
seems that we just have to work our way along as
we go. Didn&rsquo;t I say the last lap was always the
hardest of all to cover? We&rsquo;re got time for a whole
lot more adventures before we enter Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking to see some sign of that much traveled
highway ahead of us,&rdquo; Giraffe mentioned a few
minutes later. &ldquo;Seems to me we had ought to be
nearly across country by this time. When we get
out from behind those trees I calculate we&rsquo;ll be able
to glimpse something worth while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again was Giraffe correct. No sooner had
they cleared the obstruction to their view than they
discovered the road in question. It stood out in
plain sight, and there were as usual quite a number
of vehicles passing back and forth in regular procession.
Everybody seemed more or less excited. From
this fact Giraffe expressed the belief that the news
of the great French victory must have been passed
along, so that it was already common property.
Men called out to one another, and in their voluble
French fashion cried, &ldquo;Vive la France! vive Joffre!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Giraffe, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re coming to the road,
all right, but there&rsquo;s another little trouble imp laying
for us at the corner. If you look sharp you can
see some men in army blue standing there; and
they&rsquo;ve already got their eyes on this fine car. It
wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me much if they wanted to take
the same away from us, Thad. Bumpus, you said
you could walk it, if you had to; so I advise you to
get ready for business. There, that means for us
to haul up; and that man in the lead looks savage
enough to bite your head off, Bumpus; so be careful
what you say!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><span class="small">THE BADGE OF COURAGE AND HONOR</span></h2>
<p>Bumpus failed to make any reply to this taunt
on the part of Giraffe. He did sit up very straight,
however, and cast an anxious look toward the little
group of soldiers, one of whom had stepped upon
the road and half raised his gun in a suggestive way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; snapped the determined looking man
who seemed to be in command of the squad, and
wore chevrons on his sleeve to indicate that he was
a non-commissioned officer.</p>
<p>Of course he said this in French, but Thad knew
what the words stood for. Even without that
knowledge the commanding gesture with which they
were accompanied must have told what was wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are Americans, and this is our car. We
expect to go to Paris, M&rsquo;sieu. We carry a permit
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out; your car is needed by the French Government.
We are taking every one we can find.
No words now, or you may be sorry for it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>Thad did not seem to be shocked when he heard
the other say this so brutally. He knew that the
man had been sent out to round up all the means of
transportation possible, and that his orders were to
let none escape, whether the cars of the very rich,
or the vans of business men.</p>
<p>Indeed, what surprised Thad most of all was to
hear himself addressed in such excellent English.
Apparently, this man then had not spent his whole
life within the borders of his native country, but
must have lived abroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do not be in so great a hurry, M&rsquo;sieu,&rdquo; he
went on to say pleasantly, as he put his hand to his
pocket in search of the paper given to him by the
obliging colonel. &ldquo;Listen, we have been serving
France with the Red Cross. See, even now one of
my comrades still wears the band about his arm.
Then, too, we had the happiness of assisting to
carry dispatches to the front. For doing this we
received a paper to show to any one like yourself
who might wish to detain us, or take our car away.
Kindly glance your eye over this, and then decide,
M&rsquo;sieu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he flashed the magical document in
front of the bluff sergeant, who had no other recourse
but to read what was there written. It was
wonderful what a change came over the man as soon
as he saw the name at the bottom. He looked up
into the face of Thad wonderingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>&ldquo;What does it all mean?&rdquo; he demanded in a subdued
tone. &ldquo;I see a name all France loves to honor,
the man who this very day has saved our country.
Do you mean to tell me you have been with General
Joffre at the front, you boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have entered his Headquarters, we have
shaken hands with him, and he has thanked us for
what we did. More than that he gave us this paper
you can see, with his name at the bottom. Is it
enough, M&rsquo;sieu? Can we go on to Paris, where we
have promised to turn this car over to the military
authorities for their service?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bluff sergeant snatched off his cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I salute you, comrades. Pardon the little inconvenience
we have put you to. I envy you your
good fortune. The road is open to you, and here
is your wonderful paper. Would that I had
such a proud heritage to hand down to my
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood at attention, with his hand upraised, as
did the other soldiers, who while possibly not understanding
everything, had heard enough to know
that these wonderful American boys clad in those
faded khaki uniforms had been in the company of
the Great Commander.</p>
<p>Thad would have liked to converse longer with
the man, for he saw that he must be an uncommon
character, but time was too valuable to waste just
then. Bumpus was grieving, and wanting to learn
the truth as to the safety of his mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>So Thad returned the soldier&rsquo;s salute, and started
up his engine, which had been suffered to stop working
while they were detained, as gasolene or petrol
was valuable. The last they saw of the sergeant he
was waving his hand after them.</p>
<p>Bumpus drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another narrow escape!&rdquo; he ventured, with a
vein of relief in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! a miss is as good as a mile!&rdquo; sang Giraffe.
&ldquo;Some way or other we seem to get around every
difficulty that crops up. Sometimes it&rsquo;s Thad&rsquo;s
knowledge of mechanics that saves us; and then
again it turns out we have in our possession a little
magical document that makes friends out of enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Bumpus, drily, &ldquo;you forget one important
thing that has saved at least one member of
the crowd a tanning, and that&rsquo;s the possession of a
good pair of running legs, and the ability to use the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right there, Bumpus,&rdquo; acknowledged
the other. &ldquo;Now, if it had been you that
same mob was chasing after, I can see your finish,
because they&rsquo;d have grabbed you in less&rsquo;n no
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was lucky you got hungry instead of
me,&rdquo; chuckled the stout boy, as he once more settled
himself back comfortably in his seat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>The soldiers had been stationed at a commanding
point, for it was at the junction of the two roads.
No doubt they had been able to commandeer numerous
cars and other vehicles; for certain wealthy old
men in Paris having learned about the victory won
by the French army were beginning to come out,
with the desire to gaze upon the scene; and this gave
the watchers a chance to stop them and send a soldier
back in charge of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the home-stretch at last, Bumpus!&rdquo; exclaimed
Giraffe. &ldquo;I recognize this section, and we can&rsquo;t be
more&rsquo;n ten miles out of the city. Before long we&rsquo;ll
begin to catch glimpses of the distant Eiffel Tower
and some of the higher buildings. But there are
still a number of pretty little villages to pass
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thad, I&rsquo;m going to ask a favor of you!&rdquo; called
out Bumpus just then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, then,&rdquo; floated back over the shoulder
of the pilot at the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we could easily get another back here in
the tonneau of this wide car by squeezing a little.
I&rsquo;ve noticed several wounded soldiers walking
toward the city, and there&rsquo;s one right now ahead
of us. Why couldn&rsquo;t we offer to take him in, and
give him a lift? I&rsquo;d be willing to hang on outside,
if need be, so&rsquo;s to assist one or two of those noble
chaps.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for you, Bumpus; you&rsquo;re always thinking
of some one else!&rdquo; applauded Giraffe, who could
appreciate these things even if they did not seem to
come to him in the same way they did to the other
comrade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll do it, too!&rdquo; exclaimed Thad, only too
willing to be of service to one of those who trudged
along through the dust, heading for a hospital.</p>
<p>So as they overtook the walking man Bumpus
called out to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! there, don&rsquo;t you want to get in, and ride
to the city with us?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Thad brought the car to a standstill, for the soldier
had stopped upon hearing a voice hail him.
They saw that he was a youngish sort of man wearing
a short beard. He had his right arm bound up
with bandages, showing that the busy workers at
some field hospital must have taken care of him,
after which he was to go to a base hospital for
further attention and recovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do not go to Paris just yet, young Messieurs,&rdquo;
he told them in good English too, for many
Frenchmen speak the language, as they come in frequent
intercourse with the people across the Channel.
&ldquo;My home it is in a village outside the city.
First I must show myself to my wife and family,
that they may know I am yet alive. Then, too, I
have something else that they should see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>With that he turned more fully toward them, and
Thad saw to his great surprise that the private was
actually wearing a glittering emblem. It was really
the Cross of the Legion of Honor, only bestowed,
like the English Victoria Cross, upon some man who
has shown extraordinary valor in battle, performed
some wonderful feat of bravery, in fact.</p>
<p>To see it on the breast of a humble wounded
private trudging wearily along a dusty road near
Paris naturally gave the boys a thrill. They looked
upon the man now as an exalted hero, for he surely
must have done something wonderful; and yet if
that were so how did it come that he still occupied
such a humble rank?</p>
<p>His eyes were glittering with happiness. He
touched that emblem proudly, and with almost reverence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! young Messieurs,&rdquo; they heard him say, &ldquo;it
was mon colonel himself who tore this splendid
medal off his own coat and pinned it there. &lsquo;It shall
stay,&rsquo; he told me, plain Jaques Leforge and but a
private, &lsquo;it shall stay until I see your own fastened
there.&rsquo; And that too on the field of battle, with
men dying all around us. That was a most proud
moment for me, let me assure you. And as I walk
along all this way to my home I am telling myself
that my Janet and the little ones they too will be
glad, for never again can any one point a finger at
Jaques Leforge and say he is a coward, and that
his blood is water.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;What! did they say that of you, then?&rdquo; asked
Thad, deeply interested in what he was hearing, for
it seemed as though they were on the point of learning
how a miracle had been wrought in the nature
of this man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too true, M&rsquo;sieu,&rdquo; the other replied, sadly.
&ldquo;All my life I have been told that I had no spirit,
that I would never stand the test when it came to
war; that the heart of a timid man dwelt under my
uniform. So I too had come to believe it, even I,
Jaques Leforge, who should have known better. I
often told myself I was meant for only a poltroon,
a coward; and when the war came I went to my
place in my regiment believing that I should die of
fright when the guns rang in my ears, and the shells,
burst all around me. Ah! that was a strange delusion,
M&rsquo;sieu, a most strange deceit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us all about it,&rdquo; urged Giraffe; while Bumpus
leaned over and kept his eyes glued upon that
wonderful medal which the dusty private bore upon
the left bosom of his blue uniform.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know just how it happened,&rdquo; continued
the man, modesty. &ldquo;They said we would charge.
I shut my eyes, thinking that I might be tempted
to run away, and sooner than have such a disgrace
come upon me I meant to die. Then we were going
in, and all around me men were struggling and
striking and dying. I too gave and took and, most
wonderful of all, found that I was not afraid. Then
came the signal to retreat, for the enemy they were
too many for us. As we fell back the cry arose that
our colonel had fallen and was left behind. M&rsquo;sieu,
I do not know what possessed me to turn back and
run into the mass of the enemy, striking right and
left. They swarmed about me, but somehow I always
seemed to escape death. Then I saw my colonel
there upon the ground, wounded. He waved his
hand to me, seeing the blue there; but I did not stop
only long enough to snatch him up. Just then I
seemed to have the strength of a dozen men. I
fought my way through again, and staggering I
reached our lines, where my comrades nearly smothered
me with caresses. And after that my colonel
pinned this to my coat, and said I was a brave man.
The best of it to me is that he will live to lead his
men again. That is all. And I, Jaques Leforge,
did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must get in here with us,&rdquo; said Thad. &ldquo;We
will not take no for an answer. You are tired, you
are almost spent, and your home may still be some
miles away. Besides, we want to put you down
there, so that we too may see what those neighbors
will say, those who misjudged you all these years,
when they see that splendid medal, and know that
you have won it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk,&rdquo; said Giraffe, promptly; and
even Bumpus, much as he wanted to hurry along,
would not have arranged it otherwise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>So the wounded hero was helped into the car,
where they made room for him on the rear seat.
It was not more than five minutes later when he
pointed ahead with his uninjured hand and called
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, you see the little church, M&rsquo;sieu&mdash;my
house is at the corner, and that woman who is coming
out of the gate, she is my Janet, my wife!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><span class="small">CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p>As the car bore down and stopped in front of the
humble cottage gate the little French peasant woman
stared hard, as well she might. To see her &ldquo;man&rdquo;
riding in such a fine vehicle alongside four strange
young chaps was enough to make her believe in
miracles.</p>
<p>Then, as some of the boys helped Jaques to alight,
for he was trembling violently, and could hardly
have managed it with one hand, she noticed that he
had an arm bound up as though severely wounded.
With a cry she flung herself upon him and clasped
her arms about his neck.</p>
<p>Out of the cottage flew three children whom the
soldier hugged as well as he could with that single
arm. From neighboring houses flocked the inmates,
so that presently there was quite a crowd assembled
to see the strange return of Jaques Leforge, the man
whom they had always believed to be so sadly lacking
in the quality of courage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>Then some one discovered the shining badge,
pinned to the left breast of his dusty and torn blue
coat, which bore many marks of the conflict through
which he had so lately passed with such credit.
Loud cries attested to their wonder. Jaques was
called upon to explain the mystery, which he attempted
to do, perhaps after the same fashion that
he had in English given it to Thad and the others.</p>
<p>It was a picture well worth seeing. The four
scouts sat there and looked on with the keenest of
interest. Why, even Bumpus for the time being
utterly forgot that he was in a terrible hurry; for
he wanted to share in the triumph of Jacques.</p>
<p>So it sometimes happens that men, as well as boys,
bear the name of coward when it is not at all deserved.
Poor Jaques had so long been accustomed
to hearing his neighbors call him timid and weak-hearted
that he had come to take it for granted he
was really lacking in moral fiber. But when the
war came, and he actually found himself, he was not
long in proving the falsity of the charge.</p>
<p>From the abject manner of the old men and the
chattering women it was evident that the same
Jaques would from that hour rank high as the greatest
hero the little village in the environs of Paris
could ever boast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>Thad was only waiting to get a chance to shake
hands with the soldier before making a fresh start.
The others felt just as he did about it, Giraffe in
particular wanting to be able to say that he had
actually gripped the fingers of a hero to whom had
been awarded that highly prized Cross of the Legion
of Honor, which is only bestowed on those who have
shown exceptional valor on the battlefield, or in the
service of France.</p>
<p>Managing to finally catch the eye of Jaques, Thad
beckoned to him. Apparently the man understood,
and his sense of gratitude caused him to push
through the throng of admiring villagers until he
reached the side of the car. His wife and children
clung to him as though they feared he was about to
be whisked out of their sight again before they had
hardly seen him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going on, Jaques,&rdquo; said Thad, &ldquo;and
would shake hands with you first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly, young M&rsquo;sieu!&rdquo; cried the soldier,
&ldquo;though my neighbors have almost taken the life
out of my fingers already. If this is what it means
to be reckoned a hero I do not know how much of
it I may stand. But I owe you and your comrades
a debt, for which I can only give you my thanks.
Here then is this wife of mine who cannot yet believe
what her eyes tell her, and that her Jaques is
wearing a decoration. Tell me your names, if you
please, that I may introduce you to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This the boys did gladly. They were pleased to
see that the brave Jaques had such a neat and adoring
little wife, and such a healthy brood of children,
the future hope of France.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>After that there was nothing else to delay them,
and so Thad made the start. The last they saw of
Jaques he was waving his hat after them, standing
happily there in front of his own little white gate;
while the crowd still clustered around, eager to see,
and if highly favored, even touch that wonderful
badge of courage that decorated his torn and bloody
coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d call that a splendid and fitting finish to our
experience along the battle line of Joffre&rsquo;s men!&rdquo;
declared Giraffe, as soon as they were once more
progressing along the smooth road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Bumpus added, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve seen the fighting,
the taking care of the wounded, and it was only
right we should be on hand to take part in the homecoming
of the hero. Bully for Jaques, say I, and
may he long flourish. That wound of his will get
well in time, though I suppose the poor fellow may
have to go to the front again, so that perhaps he
may never live to see the end of the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistaken there, Bumpus,&rdquo; said Thad, on
hearing the stout chum paint such a grewsome outlook
for the little family of the hero; &ldquo;Jaques confided
to me that he had lost the better part of his
hand, and that hence he must be out of the war for
good, though he may still serve his country at home
in some capacity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a funny thing for me to say that I&rsquo;m
glad to hear that,&rdquo; Bumpus remarked, with a grin,
&ldquo;but you know how I mean it. Jaques has done
enough, and ought to be spared for his family&rsquo;s
sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the programme now, Thad?&rdquo; asked
Giraffe, partly rising in his seat as he spoke, in
order to stare far ahead, where through the haze
he believed he could already catch a glimpse of the
city they were heading for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find Mrs. Hawtree,&rdquo; replied the scout
leader; &ldquo;then learn how we can get a steamer for
New York. There&rsquo;s going to be a big rush on the
first and second cabin accommodations, and I&rsquo;m
afraid we&rsquo;ll have trouble in finding berths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that isn&rsquo;t going to bother me any,&rdquo; laughed
Allan, good naturedly, for with the end of the long
and arduous journey through the war-torn region
in sight he felt that it was easy to accept things as
they came. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re forced to it we can take potluck
and go steerage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing I don&rsquo;t like about that,&rdquo; declared
Giraffe, &ldquo;is the grub part of it. They say
you don&rsquo;t get all you&rsquo;d like to have in the way of
eats. But then, with so many fine society folks
having to take steerage passage, mebbe the companies
will reform, and do better. Let&rsquo;s hope so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as I find my mother, and she&rsquo;s feeling
a heap better,&rdquo; observed Bumpus, with not a line of
worry across his forehead now, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to
bother my head about such a trifling thing as eating.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; flashed Giraffe, with a grin, &ldquo;because
plump fellows such as you can be like hibernating
bears, and live on their fat for a certain
length of time; but it is a whole lot different
when a slim-jim like me has to go hungry. But I&rsquo;m
considered a pretty good rooter for grub, my folks
tell me, and if there&rsquo;s any to be had I&rsquo;ll get there.
Thad, take a good look right over there, and tell
me if you don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the old Eiffel Tower
right now standing up against the skyline like something
on stilts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that of course every one showed the most intense
interest. Thad, on looking in the quarter indicated
by Giraffe&rsquo;s extended finger, quickly announced
that the tall scout&rsquo;s eagle eye had not deceived
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the tower, most certainly,&rdquo; he said,
in a satisfied way; &ldquo;which fact tells us we&rsquo;re on the
outskirts of Paris at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything seems pretty peaceful here, I should
say,&rdquo; Bumpus remarked, just as though he may have
been indulging in some sort of wild fancy founded
on the mad scenes which history describes as having
racked the French capital at the time of the
Commune, a hundred and more years back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we&rsquo;ll find Paris pretty quiet, with so many
people gone, and business dead,&rdquo; Allan ventured to
say; &ldquo;but all the same I&rsquo;m anxious to take a turn
about the place now we&rsquo;re here. I&rsquo;ve been studying
that little guide book we got hold of, and set down
a lot of things we ought to see, before we leave for
the good old United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the belief that the great German army of
invasion might succeed in investing the capital, tens
of thousands of the best inhabitants had departed
for points further south; indeed, even the French
Assembly had abandoned Paris and gone to a safer
place, so that the legislative branch of the government
should not suffer in case of a siege, as in the
previous experience.</p>
<p>As they continued to glide along the smooth avenue,
surrounded by scenes of constantly increasing
beauty such as can be found in few other places on
earth, the four comrades of the khaki felt a sense of
peace fill their hearts. They seemed to be far removed
from those terrible battlefields upon which
they had so lately looked; and it was hard to realize
that only a score or so of miles separated the invading
German army from the goal which they had
set out to capture and hold as a prize.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>Bumpus lay back in his comfortable seat and
dreamed dreams. He had little doubt but that he
would be able to find his mother without much
trouble, and to him that September day seemed like
the end of a bad dream. All the dreadful things
that had passed in review before their eyes he would
now try to forget, since they had been but a means
to an end. Soon they would find themselves threading
the streets and broad avenues of the great metropolis,
and looking upon the myriads of fluttering
tri-color flags which would be given to the breeze as
the citizens learned of the wonderful battle which
their idol Joffre had won on the banks of the
Marne.</p>
<p>And here, having safely arrived at their goal, we
may leave them, in the hope that at no distant day it
may once again be our pleasure to meet Thad and
his gallant chums in the pages of still another volume,
in which shall be described further interesting
and profitable adventures that are likely to come
their way.</p>
